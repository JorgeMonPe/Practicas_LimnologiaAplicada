abstract = {Reservoir sediments exposed to air due to water level fluctuations are strong sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The spatial variability of CO2 fluxes from these drawdown areas are still poorly understood. In a reservoir in southeastern Brazil, we investigated whether CO2 emissions from drawdown areas vary as a function of neighboring land cover types and assessed the magnitude of CO2 fluxes from drawdown areas in relation to nearby water surface. Exposed sediments near forestland (average = 2733 mg C m−2 day−1) emitted more CO2 than exposed sediments near grassland (average = 1261 mg C m−2 day−1), congruent with a difference in organic matter content between areas adjacent to forestland (average = 12.2{\%}) and grassland (average = 10.9{\%}). Moisture also had a significant effect on CO2 emission, with dry exposed sediments (average water content: 13.7{\%}) emitting on average 2.5 times more CO2 than wet exposed sediments (average water content: 23.5{\%}). We carried out a systematic comparison with data from the literature, which indicates that CO2 efflux from drawdown areas globally is about an order of magnitude higher than CO2 efflux from adjacent water surfaces, and within the range of CO2 efflux from terrestrial soils. Our findings suggest that emissions from exposed sediments may vary substantially in space, possibly related to organic matter supply from uphill vegetation, and that drawdown areas play a disproportionately important role in total reservoir CO2 emissions with respect to the area they cover.},

@article{Holmer2001,
abstract = {1. The concentration of sulphate is low in lakes and sulphur cycling has often been neglected in studies of organic matter diagenesis in lake sediments. The cycling of sulphur is, however, both spatially and temporally dynamic and strongly influences many biogeochemical reactions in sediments, such as the binding of phosphorus. This review examines the control of sulphate reduction and sulphur cycling in sediments of lakes with different trophic status. 2. The factors that control the rate of sulphate reduction have not been identified with certainty in the various environments because many factors are involved, e.g. oxygen and sulphate concentrations, temperature and organic matter availability. 3. Sulphate reduction is less significant under oligotrophic conditions, where mineralization is dominated by oxic decomposition. The supply of organic matter may not be sufficient to support sulphate reduction in the anoxic parts of sediments and, also, sulphate availability may control the rate as the concentration is generally low in oligotrophic lakes. 4. There is a potential for significant sulphate reduction in eutrophic lakes, as both the availability of organic matter and sulphate concentration are often higher than in oligotrophic lakes. Sulphate is rapidly depleted with sediment depth, however, and methanogenesis is generally the most important process in overall carbon mineralization. Sulphate reduction is generally low in acidic lakes because of low sulphate availability and reduced microbial activity. 5. It is still unclear which of the forms of sulphur deposits are the most important and under which conditions burial occurs. Sulphur deposition is controlled by the rate of sulphate reduction and reoxidation. Reoxidation of sulphides occurs rapidly through several pathways, both under oxic and anoxic conditions. Only a few studies have been able to examine the importance of reoxidation, but it is hypothesized that most of the reoxidation takes place under anoxic conditions and that disproportionation is often involved. The presence of sulphide oxidizing bacteria, benthic fauna and rooted macrophytes may substantially enhance oxic reoxidation. Deposition of sulphur is generally higher in eutrophic than in oligotrophic lakes because of a number of factors: a higher rate of sulphate reduction, enhanced sedimentation of organic sulphur and less reoxidation as a result of reduced penetration of oxygen into the sediments, a lack of faunal activity and rooted macrophytes.},

abstract = {Reservoirs emit large amounts of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere relative to their small surface area globally. Among the different pathways of reservoir CH4 emissions, bubbling from the sediments (ebullition) and diffusion from the water surface are major contributors of CH4 efflux. The magnitude of ebullition and diffusion can vary substantially over space and time in large reservoirs. However, it is unclear how the drivers of ebullition and diffusion vary along a reservoir's longitudinal gradient, particularly in small reservoirs. We measured ebullition, diffusion, and eight environmental driver variables at four transects along a longitudinal gradient within a small, eutrophic reservoir. We used time series modeling to examine how the drivers of ebullition and diffusion varied among transects. Sediment-water interface temperature, inflow discharge, and wind speed were the most important drivers of CH4 ebullition in upstream transects of the reservoir, while phytoplankton biomass was the most important driver of ebullition in the downstream transect closest to the dam. Strikingly, CH4 ebullition dynamics were extremely well captured by the time series models, as the modeled rates for the furthest upstream transect closely matched the observed rates throughout the monitoring period. In contrast, CH4 diffusion dynamics were harder to model, with phytoplankton biomass as the primary driver of diffusion across all transects. Our results indicate that multiple drivers affect CH4 emissions along a small reservoir's longitudinal gradient and should be considered when upscaling site measurements to reservoir-wide CH4 emissions and ultimately regional or global estimates.},

abstract = {The emission fluxes and the distribution of dissolved methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were determined for 11 sampling stations in two hydroelectric reservoirs (flooded since 1978 and 1993) located in the James Bay territory of northern Qu{\'{e}}bec. The measured benthic fluxes for the two greenhouse gases were found to be either higher or similar to those determined at the water‐air interface during the ice‐free sampling periods. For the 2 year duration of the study, emission fluxes of CH4 to the atmosphere generally varied between 5 and 10 mg m−2 d−1, while those for CO2 ranged from 500 to 1100 mg m−2 d−1. Furthermore, through the use of static chambers at the water‐air interface, we determined that the emission fluxes for the gases are controlled by molecular diffusion. Our calculated fluxes have been separated into two groups: (1) regular emission fluxes and (2) above‐average emission fluxes. The first type comprises the majority of fluxes measured during the sampling periods (i.e., 88{\%} for CH4 and 87{\%} for CO2). The second group reflects unusual sampling conditions (e.g., strong winds, water column depths of less than 1 m, or flooded peatland mats floating at the surface). Although data for this group are limited, our preliminary results suggest that they may be an important component in an atmospheric emissions budget for large reservoirs. Concentration profiles for CH4 and CO2 dissolved in the water column clearly show that oxidation and/or horizontal advection of these gases are controlling factors in their subsequent release to the atmosphere. Most of the CH4 is oxidized within the first 25 cm above the flooded soil‐water interface. Consequently, neither benthic emissions of CH4 and CO2 nor the type of flooded soil appear to control atmospheric emissions of these gases from hydroelectric reservoirs.

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere from running waters are estimated to be four times greater than the total carbon (C) flux to the oceans. However, these fluxes remain poorly constrained because of substantial spatial and temporal variability in dissolved CO2 concentrations. Using a global compilation of high-frequency CO2 measurements, we demonstrate that nocturnal CO2 emissions are on average 27{\%} (0.9 gC m−2 d−1) greater than those estimated from diurnal concentrations alone. Constraints on light availability due to canopy shading or water colour are the principal controls on observed diel (24 hour) variation, suggesting this nocturnal increase arises from daytime fixation of CO2 by photosynthesis. Because current global estimates of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from running waters (0.65–1.8 PgC yr−1) rely primarily on discrete measurements of dissolved CO2 obtained during the day, they substantially underestimate the magnitude of this flux. Accounting for night-time CO2 emissions may elevate global estimates from running waters to the atmosphere by 0.20–0.55 PgC yr−1.},

abstract = {An active debate has been underway on the magnitude and duration of carbon (C) emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs, yet little attention has been paid to stochastic C emissions from reservoir sediments during extreme climatic events. A rare opportunity for field measurements of CO2 efflux from a hydroelectric reservoir in Korea during an extreme drought event was used to examine how prolonged droughts can affect microbial organic matter processing and the release of CO2, CH4 and N2O from exposed sediments. Chamber measurements of CO2 efflux along an exposed sediment transect, combined with high-frequency continuous sensor measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the reservoir surface water, exhibited extraordinary pulses of CO2 from exposed sediments and the turbulent inflowing water in contrast to a small CO2 sink in the main water body of the reservoir and a low efflux of CO2 from the flooded sediment. Significant increases in the production of CO2, CH4 and N2O observed in a laboratory incubation of sediments, together with enhanced activities of phenol oxidase and three hydrolases, indicate a temporary activation of microbial organic matter processing in the drying sediment. The results suggest that drought-triggered pulses of greenhouse gas emission from exposed sediments can offset the C accumulation in reservoir sediments over time scales of years to decades, reversing the trend of declining C emissions from aging reservoirs.},

Seven global hydrological models have been forced with multiple climate projections, and with and without taking into account impacts of human interventions such as dams and water withdrawals on the hydrological cycle. Model results are analyzed for different levels of global warming, allowing for analyses in line with temperature targets for climate change mitigation. The results indicate that direct human impacts on the water cycle in some regions, e.g., parts of Asia and in the western United States, are of the same order of magnitude, or even exceed impacts to be expected for moderate levels of global warming (+2 K). Despite some spread in model projections, irrigation water consumption is generally projected to increase with higher global mean temperatures. Irrigation water scarcity is particularly large in parts of southern and eastern Asia, and is expected to become even larger in the future.},

abstract = {Methane (CH4) represents a major product of organic matter decomposition in lakes. Once produced in the sediments, CH4 can be either oxidized or emitted as a greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. Lakes represent an important source of atmospheric CH4, but the relative magnitudes of the internal pathways that lead to CH4 emissions are not yet clear. We quantified internal cycling and methane emissions in three lakes during summer stratification. These methane budgets included: sediment release of CH4 at different depths; water column transport patterns and methane oxidation; methane storage in the water column; and methane emissions to the atmosphere by diffusion and ebullition. The contribution of CH4 carbon, via oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria, to pelagic food webs was also estimated. Despite the very low concentration of CH4 in surface waters, shallow, epilimnetic sediments were major contributors of CH4 to the atmosphere. While 51-80{\%} of the CH4 produced in deep sediments was oxidized in the water column, most of the CH4 released from shallow sediment escaped oxidation and reached the atmosphere. Epilimnetic sediments accounted for 100{\%} of CH4 emitted during summer stratification, and 14-76{\%} considering the release of CH4 stored in deep water layers during lake circulation after the stratification period; diffusive emission accounted for 26-48{\%} and ebullition the remainder. These results indicate that it is important to address transport rates of CH4 from the shallow sediment along with the production-consumption processes when trying to understand methane dynamics and the regulation of lake methane emissions.

abstract = {Hydroelectric reservoirs cover an area of 3.4× 105 km 2 and comprise about 20{\%} of all reservoirs. In addition, they contain large stores of formerly terrestrial organic carbon. Significant amounts of greenhouse gases are emitted, especially in the early years following reservoir creation, but the global extent of these emissions is poorly known. Previous estimates of emissions from all types of reservoir indicate that these human-made systems emit 321Tg of carbon per year (ref.). Here we assess the emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from hydroelectric reservoirs, on the basis of data from 85 globally distributed hydroelectric reservoirs that account for 20{\%} of the global area of these systems. We relate the emissions to reservoir age, location biome, morphometric features and chemical status. We estimate that hydroelectric reservoirs emit about 48TgC as CO 2 and 3TgC as CH 4, corresponding to 4{\%} of global carbon emissions from inland waters. Our estimates are smaller than previous estimates on the basis of more limited data. Carbon emissions are correlated to reservoir age and latitude, with the highest emission rates from the tropical Amazon region. We conclude that future emissions will be highly dependent on the geographic location of new hydroelectric reservoirs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Annual maximum lake surface temperature influences ecosystem structure and function and, in particular, the rates of metabolic activities, species survival and biogeography. Here, we evaluated 50 years of observational data, from 1966 to 2015, for ten European lakes to quantify changes in the annual maximum surface temperature and the duration above a potentially critical temperature of 20 °C. Our results show that annual maximum lake surface temperature has increased at an average rate of +0.58 °C decade−1 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.18), which is similar to the observed increase in annual maximum air temperature of +0.42 °C decade−1 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.28) over the same period. Increments in lake maximum temperature among the ten lakes range from +0.1 in the west to +1.9 °C decade−1 in the east. Absolute maximum lake surface water temperatures were reached in W{\"{o}}rthersee, 27.5 °C, and Neusiedler See, 31.7 °C. Periods exceeding a critical temperature of 20 °C each year became two to six times longer than the respective average (6 to 93). The depth at which water temperature exceeded 20 °C increased from less than 1 to more than 6 m in Mondsee, Austria, over the 50 years studied. As a consequence, the habitable environment became increasingly restricted for many organisms that are adapted to historic conditions.},

Inland waters can be an important source of methane and nitrous oxide emissions as well, but emissions are poorly quantified, especially in Africa. Here we report dissolved carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations from 12 rivers in sub-Saharan Africa, including seasonally resolved sampling at 39 sites, acquired between 2006 and 2014. Fluxes were calculated from published gas transfer velocities, and upscaled to the area of all sub-Saharan African rivers using available spatial data sets. Carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from river channels alone were about 0.4 Pg carbon per year, equivalent to two-thirds of the overall net carbon land sink previously reported for Africa. Including emissions from wetlands of the Congo river increases the total carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse-gas emissions to about 0.9 Pg carbon per year, equivalent to about one quarter of the global ocean and terrestrial combined carbon sink. Riverine carbon dioxide and methane emissions increase with wetland extent and upland biomass. We therefore suggest that future changes in wetland and upland cover could strongly affect greenhouse-gas emissions from African inland waters.},

@article{Halbedel2013,
abstract = {It has become more and more evident that CO2 emission (FCO 2) from freshwater systems is an important part of the global carbon cycle. To date, only a few studies have addressed the different mechanisms that regulate FCO2 in lotic and lentic systems. In a comparative study we investigated how different biogeochemical and physical factors can affect FCO2 values in streams and reservoirs. We examined the seasonal variability in CO2 concentrations and emissions from four streams and two pre-dams of a large drinking water reservoir located in the same catchment, and compared them with environmental factors that were measured concurrently. All the streams were generally supersaturated with CO2 throughout the year, while both reservoirs functioned to a small degree as CO2 sinks during summer stratification and CO2 sources after circulation had set in. FCO2 from streams ranged from 23 to 355 mmol m-2 d-1 and exceeded the fluxes recorded for the reservoirs (-8.9 to 161.1 mmol m-2 d-1). Both the generally high piston velocity (k) and the CO2 oversaturation contributed to the higher FCO2 from streams in comparison to lakes. In both streams and reservoirs FCO2 was mainly governed by the CO2 concentration (r Combining double low line 0.92, p {\textless} 0.001 for dams; r Combining double low line 0.90, p {\textless} 0.001 for streams), which was in turn affected by metabolic processes and nutrients in both systems and also by lateral inflow in the streams. Besides CO2 concentration, physical factors also influence FCO2 in lakes and streams. During stratification, FCO2 in both pre-dams was regulated by primary production in the epilimnion, which led to a decrease of FCO 2. During circulation, when CO2 from the hypolimnion was mixed with the epilimnion, FCO2 increased on account of the CO 2 input from the hypolimnion. The CO2 from the hypolimnion originates from the mineralisation of organic matter. FCO2 from streams was mainly influenced by geomorphological and hydrological factors affecting k, which is less relevant in low-wind lakes. Under high-wind conditions, however, k regulates FCO2 from lotic systems as well. We developed a theoretical framework describing the role of the different regulation mechanisms for FCO2 from streams and lakes. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} In summary, the dominant factor affecting FCO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the surface water. Lake stratification has a very important regulatory effect on FCO2 from lakes on account of its influence on CO2 concentrations and metabolic processes. Nevertheless, FCO2 values in heterotrophic streams are generally higher. The higher k values are responsible for the comparatively high degree of FCO2. On a Central European scale, CO2 emission from streams is probably of greater importance than the CO2 flux from standing waters. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013. CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

abstract = {Changes in the budget of dissolved methane measured in a small temperate lake over 1 year indicate that anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion and the autumn overturn period represent key factors for the overall annual methane emissions from lakes. During periods of stable stratification, large amounts of methane accumulate in anoxic deep waters. Approximately 46{\%} of the stored methane was emitted during the autumn overturn, contributing ∼80{\%} of the annual diffusive methane emissions to the atmosphere. After the overturn period, the entire water column was oxic, and only 1{\%} of the original quantity of methane remained in the water column. Current estimates of global methane emissions assume that all of the stored methane is released, whereas several studies of individual lakes have suggested that a major fraction of the stored methane is oxidized during overturns. Our results provide evidence that not all of the stored methane is released to the atmosphere during the overturn period. However, the fraction of stored methane emitted to the atmosphere during overturn may be substantially larger and the fraction of stored methane oxidized may be smaller than in the previous studies suggesting high oxidation losses of methane. The development or change in the vertical extent and duration of the anoxic hypolimnion, which can represent the main source of annual methane emissions from small lakes, may be an important aspect to consider for impact assessments of climate warming on the methane emissions from lakes. ■ INTRODUCTION Lakes are an important component of the global carbon cycle because they store and release substantial amounts of carbon dioxide 1,2 and are a particularly important source of methane in the global methane budget. 3−5 According to Bastviken et al., 6 most of the methane originating from lakes occurs in small lakes ({\textless}10 km 2), which release more methane per unit area than large lakes. 3,7 Although recent estimates of the lake size distribution suggest that the area of small lakes is only ∼26{\%} of the total global lake area, 8 methane emissions from small lakes still contribute a major fraction of global methane emissions from lakes. Estimates of global methane emissions from lakes typically distinguish between three pathways of methane release from the water body to the atmosphere: diffusive fluxes, ebullition, and release of stored methane. 6 Additionally, plant-mediated fluxes may also be an important pathway of methane emissions from lakes. 9,10 In lakes, methane is a major product of carbon cycling, 11 and most of the methane is produced within the sediments. A large proportion of this methane is removed by aerobic oxidation at oxic sediment−water interfaces or oxyclines within the water column 12 or by anaerobic oxidation. 13 Some of the methane is stored in the water column. In lakes with an anoxic hypolimnion, large amounts of dissolved methane can accumulate, which leads to a particularly large quantity of stored methane. 3,14−16 In monomictic and dimictic lakes, methane stored in anoxic hypolimnia can be released during periods of rapid vertical mixing (overturns) that occur once or twice a year, respectively. During overturn periods, the accumulated dissolved methane is redistributed over the entire water column, which can result in high diffusive methane fluxes to the atmosphere. 15,17,18 According to Bastviken et al., 3 the contribution of the stored methane to the overall annual methane emissions (the "storage flux") increases with decreasing lake size and reaches approximately 45{\%} in small lakes. However, this estimate assumes that all of the stored methane is released to the atmosphere. Conversely, several other studies 15,18,19 have claimed that most of the stored methane is oxidized in the water column during the overturn period. This suggests that a major contribution to the estimate of annual methane emissions from small lakes may have been substantially overestimated. Most of the studies that have investigated fluxes of stored methane have focused on the autumn overturn and its contribution to the overall annual methane emissions. 3 Recently, additional studies have investigated methane emissions during the spring overturn or spring and autumn},

Nevertheless, despite the global occurrence of these systems, the carbon effluxes from such water bodies have been largely overlooked. In this study, we examined the intra- and intersystem variability of carbon dioxide (CO2) effluxes from a set of Mediterranean temporary ponds during the flooding phase, a hot-spot for biogeochemical cycling in temporary systems. The CO2 effluxes showed higher variability among the various sections of each pond (i.e., inundated, emerged-unvegetated and emerged-vegetated) than among the ponds. The emerged-vegetated sections showed the highest CO2 effluxes per unit area and tended to drive the total effluxes at the whole-ecosystem scale. The mean CO2 efflux (121.3±138.1 mmol m–2 d–1) was in the upper range for freshwater ecosystems. The CO2 effluxes were not related to catchment properties but rather to the organic content of the sediments, especially in the emerged sections of the ponds.Our results indicate that temporary ponds, especially their emerged sections, are important sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, highlighting the need to include the dry phases of these and other temporary aquatic systems in regional carbon budgets.},

abstract = {Due to climate change, many lakes in Europe will be subject to higher variability of hydrological characteristics in their littoral zones. These different hydrological regimes might affect the use of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon sources. We used sandy sediment microcosms to examine the effects of different hydrological regimes (wet, desiccating, and wet-desiccation cycles) on carbon turnover. 13C-labelled particulate organic carbon was used to trace and estimate carbon uptake into bacterial biomass (via phospholipid fatty acids) and respiration. Microbial community changes were monitored by combining DNA- and RNA-based real-time PCR quantification and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of 16S rRNA. The shifting hydrological regimes in the sediment primarily caused two linked microbial effects: changes in the use of available organic carbon and community composition changes. Drying sediments yielded the highest CO2 emission rates, whereas hydrological shifts increased the uptake of allochthonous organic carbon for respiration. T-RFLP patterns demonstrated that only the most extreme hydrological changes induced a significant shift in the active and total bacterial communities. As current scenarios of climate change predict an increase of drought events, frequent variations of the hydrological regimes of many lake littoral zones in central Europe are anticipated. Based on the results of our study, this phenomenon may increase the intensity and amplitude in rates of allochthonous organic carbon uptake and CO2 emissions.},

abstract = {Globally, reservoirs are a significant source of atmospheric CO2. However, precise quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from drinking water reservoirs on the regional or national scale is still challenging. We calculated CO2 fluxes for 39 German drinking water reservoirs during a period of 22 years (1991–2013) using routine monitoring data in order to quantify total emission of CO2 from drinking water reservoirs in Germany and to identify major drivers. All reservoirs were a net CO2 source with a median flux of 167 g C m− 2 y− 1, which makes gaseous emissions a relevant process for the carbon budget of each reservoir. Fluxes varied seasonally with median fluxes of 13, 48, and 201 g C m− 2 y− 1 in spring, summer, and autumn respectively. Differences between reservoirs appeared to be primarily caused by the concentration of CO2 in the surface water rather than by the physical gas transfer coefficient. Consideration of short term fluctuations of the gas transfer coefficient due to varying wind speed had only a minor effect on the annual budgets. High CO2 emissions only occurred in reservoirs with pH {\textless} 7 and total alkalinity {\textless} 0.2 mEq l− 1. Annual CO2 emissions correlated exponentially with pH but not with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). There was significant correlation between land use in the catchment and CO2 emissions. In total, German drinking water reservoirs emit 44000 t of CO2 annually, which makes them a negligible CO2 source ({\textless} 0.005{\%} of national CO2 emissions) in Germany.},

abstract = {Reservoirs are key components of water infrastructure that serve many functions (water supply, hydropower generation, flood control, recreation, ecosystem services, etc.). Climate change affects the hydrology of the tributary areas to reservoirs, which may profoundly impact their operation and possibly the reservoirs' water quality, among which the temperature gradient and the total dissolved solids (TDS) are key qualitative characteristics of reservoirs, especially those with irrigation function. This study examines water-quality changes in the Aidoghmoush reservoir (East Azerbaijan-Iran) under climate-change conditions in the period 2026–2039. The temperature and precipitation climate variables are calculated by the HadCM3 model driven by emission scenario A2 in the baseline period (1987–2000), and these variables are then projected over the future period (2026–2039). The average annual runoff under climate-change conditions is simulated by the IHACRES model. The results show the future average annual runoff would decrease by about 1{\%} compared to the baseline conditions. The CE-QUAL-W2 model is employed to simulate the reservoir water quality. It is predicted the surface air temperature would increase by 1.3 °C under the climate-change scenario compared to the baseline condition, and the temperatures of the reservoir's surface- and bottom-waters would increase by 1.19 and 1.24 °C, respectively. The average TDS near the reservoir surface would increase by 44.5 g/m 3 (4.3{\%}) relative to baseline TDS. The TDS near the reservoir surface are projected to be highest in autumn and winter for baseline and future conditions. This research shows that changes due to climate change are potentially severe, and presents a methodology that could assist managers and planners to find optimal strategies of reservoir operation to cope with changes in thermal stratification and TDS. This paper results identify the reservoir levels from which to withdraw water with the best water-quality characteristics.},

However, fluxes are difficult to measure because of the often rocky substrate and the dynamic nature of the habitat. Here we tested the performance of different materials to seal a closed chamber to stony ground both in laboratory and field experiments. Using on-site material consistently resulted in elevated fluxes. The artefact was caused both by outgassing of the material and production of gas. The magnitude of the artefact was site dependent the measured CO 2 flux increased between 10 and 208 {\%}. Errors due to incomplete sealing proved to be more severe than errors due to non-inert sealing material. Pottery clay as sealing material provided a tight seal between the chamber and the ground and no production of gases was detected. With this approach it is possible to get reliable gas fluxes from hard-substrate sites without using a permanent collar. Our test experiments confirmed that CO 2 fluxes from dry aquatic sediments are similar to CO 2 fluxes from terrestrial soils.},

abstract = {Six reservoirs located in the Western United States (F. D. Roosevelt, Dworshak, Wallula, Shasta, Oroville, and New Melones) were sampled in order to estimate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Two types of fluxes were assessed: (1) diffusive fluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) at the air/water interface and (2) degassing fluxes of CH4 and CO2 from water passing through the turbine spillways. Diffusive flux measurements indicated that the surface of the reservoirs were a source of CH4 during the sampling period (from +3.2 to +9.5 mg CH4 m -2 d-1). Oroville (+1026 mg CO2 m-2 d-1) and Shasta (+1247 mg CO2 m -2 d-1) surfaces were also sources of CO 2. In contrast, the surface of all the other reservoirs constituted sinks for CO2 (from -349 to -1195 mg CO 2 m-2 d-1). Degassing fluxes ranged from +0.003 to +0.815 t CH4 d-1, and from +16 to +324 t CO2 d-1. Daily GHG budgets ranged from +0.146 to +2.228 t CH4 d-1, and from -15 to +224 t CO2 d-1. Degassing fluxes represented an important term of these budgets. A significant correlation was observed between the magnitude of CO2 diffusive fluxes and the water pH (R2 = 0.81; p {\textless} 0.0001). All other correlations between GHG diffusive fluxes and independent variables tested were weak and/or not significant. Finally, while attempting to resolve the spatial variability in diffusive fluxes, we were able to cluster reservoirs neither according to geological nor ecological criteria.

We assembled the largest global dataset to date on emission rates of all three GHGs and found they covary with lake size and trophic state. Fitted models were upscaled to estimate global emission using global lake size inventories and a remotely sensed global lake productivity distribution. Traditional upscaling approaches overestimated CO2 and N2O emission but underestimated CH4 by half. Our upscaled size-productivity weighted estimates (1.25–2.30 Pg of CO2-equivalents annually) are nearly 20{\%} of global CO2 fossil fuel emission with ∼ 75{\%} of the climate impact due to CH4. Moderate global increases in eutrophication could translate to 5–40{\%} increases in the GHG effects in the atmosphere, adding the equivalent effect of another 13{\%} of fossil fuel combustion or an effect equal to GHG emissions from current land use change.},

abstract = {1. The near-surface distribution of phytoplankton cells along the thalweg of a canyon- shaped reservoir (El Gergal, southern Spain) during two surveys is described and interpreted as the result of time-varying large-scale circulation patterns, vertical mixing processes and the physiological capacity of algal cells to regulate its position in the water column. 2. Vertical gradients of chlorophyll-a concentration developed in the water column during the day but disappeared at night, as a result of the shoaling and deepening of the diurnal mixed layer (dml). The changes in the depth of the dml are largely controlled in El Gergal by convectively driven mixing processes. The longitudinal circulation changes, in turn, as a result of weak and diurnal land-sea breezes. The distribution of algal cells was patchy at all times but did not change during any of the surveys. 3. An expression is proposed to estimate time scales for the development of horizontal patchiness TP based on simple concepts of transport. It is shown that TP is in the order of a week, indicating that horizontal patchiness does not respond immediately to hourly changes in the controlling factors. The magnitude of TP, though, depends on how the vertical distribution of chlorophyll-a and longitudinal currents change on subdiurnal time scales. In particular, TP is sensitive to the lag existing between the momentum and heat fluxes through the free surface, driving circulation and vertical mixing.},

abstract = {Although previous studies suggest that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from reservoir sediment exposed to the atmosphere during drought may be substantial, this process has not been rigorously quantified. Here we determined carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) emissions from sediment cores exposed to a drying and rewetting cycle. We found a strong temporal variation in GHG emissions with peaks when the sediment was drained (C emissions from permanently wet sediment and drained sediments were, respectively, 251 and 1646 mg m −2 d −1 for CO 2 and 0.8 and 547.4 mg m −2 d −1 for CH 4) and then again during rewetting (C emissions from permanently wet sediment and rewetted sediments were, respectively, 456 and 1725mg m −2 d −1 for CO 2 and 1.3 and 3.1 mg m −2 d −1 for CH 4). To gain insight into the importance of these emissions at a regional scale, we used Landsat satellite imagery to upscale our results to all Brazilian reservoirs. We found that during the extreme drought of 2014-2015, an additional 1299 km 2 of sediment was exposed, resulting in an estimated emission of 8.5 × 10 11 g of CO 2-eq during the first 15 d after the overlying water disappeared and in the first 33 d after rewetting, the same order of magnitude as the year-round GHG emissions of large (∼mean surface water area 454 km 2) Brazilian reservoirs, excluding the emissions from the draw-down zone. Our estimate, however, has high uncertainty, with actual emissions likely higher. We therefore argue that the effects of drought on reservoir GHG emissions merits further study, especially because climate models indicate an increase in the frequency of severe droughts in the future. We recommend incorporation of emissions during drying and rewetting into GHG budgets of reservoirs to improve regional GHG emission estimates and to enable comparison between GHG emissions from hydroelectric and other electricity sources. We also emphasize that peak emissions at the onset of drought and the later rewetting should be quantified to obtain reliable emission estimates. ARTICLE HISTORY},

abstract = {Freshwater reservoirs are a known source of greenhouse gas (GHG) to the atmosphere, but their quantitative significance is still only loosely constrained. Although part of this uncertainty can be attributed to the difficulties in measuring highly variable fluxes, it is also the result of a lack of a clear accounting methodology, particularly about what constitutes new emissions and potential new sinks. In this paper, we review the main processes involved in the generation of GHG in reservoir systems and propose a simple approach to quantify the reservoir GHG footprint in terms of the net changes in GHG fluxes to the atmosphere induced by damming, that is, ‘what the atmosphere sees.' The approach takes into account the pre-impoundment GHG balance of the landscape, the temporal evolution of reservoir GHG emission profile as well as the natural emissions that are displaced to or away from the reservoir site resulting from hydrological and other changes. It also clarifies the portion of the reservoir carbon burial that can potentially be considered an offset to GHG emissions.},

abstract = {Study region: Tarago Reservoir, Victoria, Australia. Study focus: This study investigates the influence of rainfall, river inflow and wind on the temperature stratification of the Tarago Reservoir by incorporating atmospheric and bathymetric conditions using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. New hydrological insights for this region: In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model was developed and applied to the Tarago Reservoir. The model allowed 3D visualization of the thermal structure, and the seasonal and longitudinal differences in stratification could be quantified using the Schmidt stability index. The simulation results revealed longitudinal differences in thermal structure among the riverine, transition, and lacustrine zones. The bathymetry affects the lake stratification and stability; furthermore, the strong vertical current caused by the sharp bathymetry gradient significantly weakens the stability in deep zones. In addition, this study assessed the impacts of rainfall and wind on lake stability using sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that rainfall decreases the water temperature of the lake but hardly affects the summer stratification. Moreover, the wind not only influences the intensity and duration of stratification but also contributes to the heat storage of waterbodies. The patterns of water current velocities and temperature also showed that the circulation generated by overflow and underflow plumes have a crucial effect on the thermal structure of the transition and lacustrine zones.},

To enable advanced assessments of the role and effects of dams within the global river network and to support strategies for mitigating ecohydrological and socioeconomic costs, we introduce here the spatially explicit and hydrologically linked Global Reservoir and Dam database (GRanD). As of early 2011, GRanD contains information regarding 6862 dams and their associated reservoirs, with a total storage capacity of 6197 km 3. On the basis of these records, we estimate that about 16.7 million reservoirs larger than 0.01 ha - with a combined storage capacity of approximately 8070 km 3 - may exist worldwide, increasing Earth's terrestrial surface water area by more than 305 000 km 2. We find that 575 900 river kilometers, or 7.6{\%} of the world's rivers with average flows above 1 cubic meter per second (m 3 s -1), are affected by a cumulative upstream reservoir capacity that exceeds 2{\%} of their annual flow; the impact is highest for large rivers with average flows above 1000 m 3 s -1, of which 46.7{\%} are affected. Finally, a sensitivity analysis suggests that smaller reservoirs have substantial impacts on the spatial extent of flow alterations despite their minor role in total reservoir capacity. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

Yet, information on the gaseous carbon (C) fluxes from dry inland waters is scarce, thus precluding a comprehensive assessment of C emissions including all, also intermittently dry, inland waters. Here, we review current knowledge on gaseous C fluxes from lotic (streams and rivers) and lentic (ponds, lakes, and reservoirs) inland waters during dry phases and the response to rewetting, considering controls and sources as well as implications of including ‘dry' fluxes for local and global scale estimates. Moreover, knowledge gaps and research needs are discussed.

abstract = {Goal, Scope and Background. Humans now strongly influence almost every major aquatic ecosystem, and their activities have dramatically altered the fluxes of growth-limiting nutrients from the landscape to receiving waters. Unfortunately, these nutrient inputs have had profound negative effects upon the quality of surface waters worldwide. This review examines how eutrophication influences the biomass and species composition of algae in both freshwater and costal marine systems. Main Features. An overview of recent advances in algae-related eutrophication research is presented. In freshwater systems, a summary is presented for lakes and reservoirs; streams and rivers; and wetlands. A brief summary is also presented for estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems. Results. Eutrophication causes predictable increases in the biomass of algae in lakes and reservoirs; streams and rivers; wetlands; and coastal marine ecosystems. As in lakes, the response of suspended algae in large rivers to changes in nutrient loading may be hysteretic in some cases. The inhibitory effects of high concentrations of inorganic suspended solids on algal growth, which can be very evident in many reservoirs receiving high inputs of suspended soils, also potentially may occur in turbid rivers. Consistent and predictable eutrophication-caused increases in cyanobacterial dominance of phytoplankton have been reported worldwide for natural lakes, and similar trends are reported here both for phytoplankton in turbid reservoirs, and for suspended algae in a large river. Conclusions. A remarkable unity is evident in the global response of algal biomass to nitrogen and phosphorus availability in lakes and reservoirs; wetlands; streams and rivers; and coastal marine waters. The species composition of algal communities inhabiting the water column appears to respond similarly to nutrient loading, whether in lakes, reservoirs, or rivers. As is true of freshwater ecosystems, the recent literature suggests that coastal marine ecosystems will respond positively to nutrient loading control efforts. Recommendations and Outlook. Our understanding of freshwater eutrophication and its effects on algal-related water quality is strong and is advancing rapidly. However, our understanding of the effects of eutrophication on estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems is much more limited, and this gap represents an important future research need. Although coastal systems can be hydrologically complex, the biomass of marine phytoplankton nonetheless appears to respond sensitively and predictably to changes in the external supplies of nitrogen and phosphorus. These responses suggest that efforts to manage nutrient inputs to the seas will result in significant improvements in coastal zone water quality. Additional new efforts should be made to develop models that quantitatively link ecosystem-level responses to nutrient loading in both freshwater and marine systems.},

abstract = {The horizontal distribution of phytoplankton in a medium-size canyon type reservoir, forced by weak winds of 3–4 ms-1, is largely driven by the interaction of the large-scale circulation and processes regulating the vertical distribution of algal cells in the water column. These drivers, in turn, are subject to diurnal variations, making our understanding of the horizontal distribution of phytoplankton a challenging task. A three-dimensional physical-–ecological model is used to understand the spa- tial distribution of algae and the role of diurnal variations in the physical–biological drivers. The model was used to demonstrate that the large-scale circulation induced during the day is more efficient generating patchiness than the circulation existing at night, when convectively driven turbulence homogenizes the upper layers. Different spatial distributions develop for different populations and under different forcing scenarios, characterized in terms of the directionality of wind forcing, wind magnitude and the lags between winds and diel heat fluxes. The time scales needed so that algal biomass in the surface exhibit significant longitudinal gradients—TP—will vary depending on the algal group, and its ability to regulate its vertical position. These scales are shorter for those species that either migrate actively in the water column or exhibit positive buoyancy (Cryptophytes or Positive buoyant algae). In El Gergal, these scales TP are on the order of a few days. Synoptic changes in the meteorological forcing, like the passing of a front, could potentially change the longitudinal distribution of algal biomass if they persist for periods of time longer than Tp.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Thermokarst lakes in the Arctic and Subarctic release carbon from thawing permafrost in the form of methane and carbon dioxide with important implications for regional and global carbon cycles. Lake ice impedes the release of gas during the winter. For instance, bubbles released from lake sediments become trapped in downward growing lake ice, resulting in vertically-oriented bubble columns in the ice that are visible on the lake surface. We here describe a classification technique using an object-based image analysis (OBIA) framework to successfully map ebullition bubbles in airborne imagery of early winter ice on an interior Alaska thermokarst lake. Ebullition bubbles appear as white patches in high-resolution optical remote sensing images of snow-free lake ice acquired in early winter and, thus, can be mapped across whole lake areas. We used high-resolution (9–11 cm) aerial images acquired two and four days following freeze-up in the years 2011 and 2012, respectively. The design of multiresolution segmentation and region-specific classification rulesets allowed the identification of bubble features and separation from other confounding factors such as snow, submerged and floating vegetation, shadows, and open water. The OBIA technique had an accuracy of {\textgreater}95{\%} for mapping ebullition bubble patches in early winter lake ice. Overall, we mapped 1195 and 1860 ebullition bubble patches in the 2011 and 2012 images, respectively. The percent surface area of lake ice covered with ebullition bubble patches for 2011 was 2.14{\%} and for 2012 was 2.67{\%}, representing a conservative whole lake estimate of bubble patches compared to ground surveys usually conducted on thicker ice 10 or more days after freeze-up. Our findings suggest that the information derived from high-resolution optical images of lake ice can supplement spatially limited field sampling methods to better estimate methane flux from individual lakes. The method can also be used to improve estimates of methane ebullition from numerous lakes within larger regions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {There is growing concern about the transfer of methane originating from water bodies to the atmosphere. Methane from sediments can reach the atmosphere directly via bubbles or indirectly via vertical turbulent transport. This work quantifies methane gas bubble dissolution using a combination of bubble modeling and acoustic observations of rising bubbles to determine what fraction of the methane transported by bubbles will reach the atmosphere. The bubble model predicts the evolving bubble size, gas composition, and rise distance and is suitable for almost all aquatic environments. The model was validated using methane and argon bubble dissolution measurements obtained from the literature for deep, oxic, saline water with excellent results. Methane bubbles from within the hydrate stability zone (typically below ∼500 m water depth in the ocean) are believed to form an outer hydrate rim. To explain the subsequent slow dissolution, a model calibration was performed using bubble dissolution data from the literature measured within the hydrate stability zone. The calibrated model explains the impressively tall flares ({\textgreater}1300 m) observed in the hydrate stability zone of the Black Sea. This study suggests that only a small amount of methane reaches the surface at active seep sites in the Black Sea, and this only from very shallow water areas ({\textless}100 m). Clearly, the Black Sea and the ocean are rather effective barriers against the transfer of bubble methane to the atmosphere, although substantial amounts of methane may reach the surface in shallow lakes and reservoirs.

abstract = {The magnitude of diffusive carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission from man-made reservoirs is uncertain because the spatial variability generally is not well-represented. Here, we examine the spatial variability and its drivers for partial pressure, gas-exchange velocity (k), and diffusive flux of CO2 and CH4 in three tropical reservoirs using spatially resolved measurements of both gas concentrations and k. We observed high spatial variability in CO2 and CH4 concentrations and flux within all three reservoirs, with river inflow areas generally displaying elevated CH4 concentrations. Conversely, areas close to the dam are generally characterized by low concentrations and are therefore not likely to be representative for the whole system. A large share (44-83{\%}) of the within-reservoir variability of gas concentration was explained by dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll, water depth, and within-reservoir location. High spatial variability in k was observed, and kCH4 was persistently higher (on average, 2.5 times more) than k CO2. Not accounting for the within-reservoir variability in concentrations and k may lead to up to 80{\%} underestimation of whole-system diffusive emission of CO2 and CH4. Our findings provide valuable information on how to develop field-sampling strategies to reliably capture the spatial heterogeneity of diffusive carbon fluxes from reservoirs.},

To improve understanding of how sediment mechanical properties influence bubble growth and transport in freshwater sediments, a 20-day laboratory incubation experiment using homogenized natural clay and sand was performed. Methane bubble development at high resolution was characterized by $\mu$CT. Initially, capillary invasion by microbubbles ({\textless}0.1 mm) dominated bubble formation, with continued gas production (4 days for clay; 8 days for sand), large bubbles formed by deforming the surrounding sediment, leading to enhanced of macropore connectivity in both sediments. Growth of large bubbles ({\textgreater}1 mm) was possible in low shear yield strength sediments ({\textless}100 Pa), where excess gas pressure was sufficient to displace the sediment. Lower within the sand, higher shear yield strength ({\textgreater}360 Pa) resulted in a predominance of microbubbles where the required capillary entry pressure was low. Enhanced bubble migration, triggered by a controlled reduction in hydrostatic head, was observed throughout the clay column, while in sand mobile bubbles were restricted to the upper 6 cm. The observed macropore network was the dominant path for bubble movement and release in both sediments.},

abstract = {The purpose of this review is to highlight progress in unraveling carbon cycling dynamics across the continuum of landscapes, inland waters, coastal oceans, and the atmosphere. Earth systems are intimately interconnected, yet most biogeochemical studies focus on specific components in isolation. The movement of water drives the carbon cycle, and, as such, inland waters provide a critical intersection between terrestrial and marine biospheres. Inland, estuarine, and coastal waters are well studied in regions near centers of human population in the Northern hemisphere. However, many of the world's large river systems and their marine receiving waters remain poorly characterized, particularly in the tropics, which contribute to a disproportionately large fraction of the transformation of terrestrial organic matter to carbon dioxide, and the Arctic, where positive feedback mechanisms are likely to amplify global climate change. There are large gaps in current coverage of environmental observations along the aquatic continuum. For example, tidally-influenced reaches of major rivers and near-shore coastal regions around river plumes are often left out of carbon budgets due to a combination of methodological constraints and poor data coverage. We suggest that closing these gaps could potentially alter global estimates of CO2 outgassing from surface waters to the atmosphere by several-fold. Finally, in order to identify and constrain/embrace uncertainties in global carbon budget estimations it is important that we further adopt statistical and modeling approaches that have become well-established in the fields of oceanography and paleoclimatology, for example.},

abstract = {The magnitude of stream and river carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is affected by seasonal changes in watershed biogeochemistry and hydrology. Global estimates of this flux are, however, uncertain, relying on calculated values for CO2 and lacking spatial accuracy or seasonal variations critical for understanding macroecosystem controls of the flux. Here, we compiled 5,910 direct measurements of fluvial CO2 partial pressure and modeled them against watershed properties to resolve reach-scale monthly variations of the flux. The direct measurements were then combined with seasonally resolved gas transfer velocity and river surface area estimates from a recent global hydrography dataset to constrain the flux at the monthly scale. Globally, fluvial CO2 emission varies between 112 and 209 Tg of carbon per month. The monthly flux varies much more in Arctic and northern temperate rivers than in tropical and southern temperate rivers (coefficient of variation: 46 to 95 vs. 6 to 12{\%}). Annual fluvial CO2 emission to terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) ratio is highly variable across regions, ranging from negligible ({\textless}0.2{\%}) to 18{\%}. Nonlinear regressions suggest a saturating increase in GPP and a nonsaturating, steeper increase in fluvial CO2 emission with discharge across regions, which leads to higher percentages of GPP being shunted into rivers for evasion in wetter regions. This highlights the importance of hydrology, in particular water throughput, in routing terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere via the global drainage networks. Our results suggest the need to account for the differential hydrological responses of terrestrial-atmospheric vs. fluvial-atmospheric carbon exchanges in plumbing the terrestrial carbon budget.},

We developed a mechanistic model that integrates the reactivity continuum (RC) concept to reconstruct in-lake mineralization of DOCalloch under variable hydrologic conditions using empirical measurements of DOCalloch concentrations and reactivity as model inputs.

The modeled DOCalloch mineralization rates and concentrations were in agreement with expectations based on observed and published values of ambient lake DOC concentrations and reactivity. Results from this modeling exercise reveal that the interaction between WRT and k 0 is a key determinant of the ambient concentration and reactivity of lake DOCalloch, which represents the bulk of DOC in most of these lakes. The steady-state {\$}{\$} $\backslash$left( {\{}$\backslash$bar{\{}K{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}alloch{\}}{\}} {\}} $\backslash$right) {\$}{\$} also represents the proportion of CO2 that can be extracted from DOCalloch during its transit through lakes, and partly explains the patterns in surface water pCO2 oversaturation that have been observed across gradients of lake size and volume. We estimate that in-lake DOCalloch mineralization could potentially contribute on average 30–40{\%} of the observed surface carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) across northern lakes. Applying the RC framework to in-lake DOCalloch dynamics improves our understanding of DOCalloch transformation and fate along the aquatic network, and results in a predictable mosaic of DOC reactivity and potential CO2 emissions across lakes within a landscape.},

abstract = {Lake basins (∼ 2.7 × 106 km2, about 0.8{\%} of the ocean surface or 2{\%} of the land surface) bury a surprisingly high amount of atmospheric carbon (∼ 70 × 106 t/a) which reaches more than one fourth of the annual atmospheric carbon burial in the modern oceans. This is mainly accomplished by the rapid accumulation of lacustrine sediments and a very high preservation factor (on average 50 times higher than that in the oceans). Lakes with relatively large drainage areas commonly display the highest carbon accumulation rates. In most cases, burial of organic matter is more important than that of carbonate carbon produced by silicate weathering, in contrast to the oceans where the burial of atmospheric carbonate carbon almost reaches the same amount as that of organic carbon. Exceptions to this rule are closed lake basins in arid to semiarid climate which precipitate a major part of their atmosphere-derived dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as carbonate. These results are demonstrated in some detail for L. Qinghai, China, (low contribution of atmospheric carbonate carbon) and L. Turkana, East Africa, (high contribution from silicate rocks). Further data are gained by estimates for a number of closed and open lakes. The drainage areas of the lakes withdraw atmospheric carbon at rates of mostly 1-4 g/m2/a, calculated from the lacustrine carbon burial. Carbon burial rates in lakes commonly increase with change to wetter and warmer climate (partially larger lake surfaces, higher rates of seasonal carbonate precipitation, trend to stratified lake waters with oxygen-deficient bottom water). Anthropogenic influence mostly enhances the production and preservation of organic carbon in lake basins (often by a factor of 3-4). After the last glacial maximum, the joint action of the globally spreading vegetation, peat growth, and carbon burial in lakes would have been able to reduce the atmospheric carbon pool to one third to one half of its present amount within a time period of 1 ka. However, CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean has brought about an overall increase in the atmospheric CO2 during the Holocene. The contribution of lakes and artificial reservoirs in counteracting man-made CO2 emissions should not be neglected. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hydroelectric reservoirs can release significant quantities of CO 2, but very few results are available from the tropics. The objective of the present study was to estimate the emission of CO2 from the Balbina hydroelectric reservoir in the central Brazilian Amazon. Diffusive and ebullitive emissions were estimated at regular intervals, both above and below the dam, using a combination of static chambers and submerged funnels. Gas releases immediately below the dam were calculated as the difference between gas flux at the entrance and the outflow of the hydroelectric turbines. An inundation model derived from a bathymetric map and daily stage readings was used for spatial and temporal interpolation of reservoir emissions. Annual emissions of CO2, upstream and downstream of Balbina dam for 2005, were estimated as 2450 and 81 Gg C, respectively, for a total annual flux of 2531 Gg C. Upstream emissions were predominantly diffusive with only 0.02 Gg C yr-1 resulting from ebullition. On average, 51{\%} of the downstream emission was released by degassing at the turbine outflow, and the remainder was lost by diffusion from the downstream river. The total annual greenhouse gas emission from Balbina dam, including the CO2 equivalent of previously estimated CH4 emissions, was 3 Tg C yr-1, equivalent to approximately 50{\%} of the CO2 emissions derived from the burning of fossil fuels in the Brazilian metropolis of S{\~{a}}o Paulo.

abstract = {Thermal stratification is crucial for water quality and ecological processes in deep lakes and reservoirs and can be substantially affected by meteorological and hydrological processes in the catchment. However, how thermal stratification responds to rainfalls of different intensities and changing hydrological processes has not been documented very well. Here, high frequency water column profiles at three stations in a large subtropical deep reservoir (Lake Qiandaohu, China) in 2017 were used to elucidate the impacts of rainfall on lake physical process and chemical environment. The impact of rainfalls on the thermal stratification and dissolved oxygen in riverine zone was more impressive than that in transitional and lacustrine zones. The effect on thermal stratification by rainfall was largely affected by the magnitude of rainfall. Moderate and heavy rainfall events could reduce the thermal stability of water column, deepen the mixing layer depth, and shape the thermocline, resulting from decrease of surface water temperature and increased inflows. While rainstorms could totally break up thermoclines in the riverine zone by high volume inflow flushing. In addition, we found that the hypoxia and anoxia initial depths increased during rainfall events in this reservoir, which were well related to the changes of mixing layer depths. This research highlights that quantifying the effects of rainfalls on thermal stratification and dissolved oxygen will be beneficial for optimizing reservoir management.},

abstract = {We examined temperature trends in a 20-year set of monitoring records collected at multiple deep-water stations in the central basin of Lake Erie. Data collected were statistically corrected ("deseasonalized") to remove biases resulting from irregular sampling intervals within years. Depth-integrated summer temperature has increased by an average (±SE) of 0.037 ± 0.01 °C per year. An observed reduction of Secchi depth (SD) by 7 ± 3 cm/y seems to be unrelated to variation in either total phosphorus (TP) or chlorophyll a concentrations. Midsummer midbasin SD values varied widely between 4 and 10 m, possibly depending on whether phytoplankton were concentrated in the epilimnion (giving shallow SD), or whether phytoplankton had settled out of the epilimnion into the lower layers, giving deeper SD values. Hypolimnetic volume-corrected oxygen depletion (HVOD) rates have also been highly variable, ranging from 2.68 to 4.72 mg/L/mo. These rates are sensitive to production of oxygen in the thermocline and hypolimnion by photosynthetically active phytoplankton that have settled from the epilimnion. The HVOD rate in any year was correlated with the previous year's TP loading into Lake Erie. Since TP loading trends largely reflect the consequences of improving water treatment through the 1980s and increasing contributions from tributary run-off sediments through the 1990s, there is little direct evidence to suggest that the appearance of dreissenids has directly influenced hypolimnial oxygen depletion rates in the central basin. The observation that central-basin HVOD tracked the reductions in TP loadings through the 1980s may be the first affirmation that central basin hypolimnetic oxygen dynamics can be regulated by phosphorus inputs. This implies that TP loads must continue to be regulated if we wish to minimize oxygen depletion rates as a strategy to reduce the frequency of episodic central basin anoxia.},

abstract = {El Gergal is the last link in a system of reservoirs located in the Rivera de Huelva River, Seville (South-West Spain). Because of its position within the system and the different water transfer possibilities between reservoirs, the florisitic composition of phytoplankton in El Gergal can be strongly influenced by the concentration of cells present in the water transferred from other reservoirs in the series. In June 2000 a large Ceratium hirundinella inoculums was transferred from an upstream reservoir into El Gergal. The dinoflagellate inoculums entered in the receiving reservoir through the riverine zone depicting a marked horizontal structure, and inducing an intense summer bloom. Our results show that this Ceratium bloom was effective to compete and counteract the later development of the harmful cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Further, after the integration of a set of adaptations to the semi-arid Mediterranean region and subsequently validation, the PROTECH model (a 1D phytoplankton community model) was used to describe, assess and evaluate the potential impact on El Gergal phytoplankton dynamics of an alternative water transfer strategy. Finally, we encourage the use of dynamic modelling in lakes and reservoir management, as it constitutes a powerful tool that should offer reliable predictions and help managers in the usually difficult and complex task of adopting optimal decisions, in order to minimise water treatment costs and provide the best possible environmental quality. {\textcopyright} Asociaci{\'{o}}n Espa{\~{n}}ola de Limnolog{\'{i}}a.},

Average OC burial efficiency was high (mean 48{\%}), and it was particularly high in sediments receiving high input of allochthonous organic matter (mean 67{\%}). Further, OC burial efficiency was strongly negatively related to the oxygen exposure time, again particularly so in sediments receiving high allochthonous loads. On the other hand, OC burial efficiency was not related to the mineral surface area, which was used as a proxy of the sorption capacity of the mineral phase for OC. The high OC burial efficiency in many lake sediments can thus be attributed to the frequent and significant input of allochthonous organic matter to lakes, as well as to a strong dependence of OC burial efficiency on oxygen exposure time. This study demonstrates that the carbon sink in lake sediments alters the OC export from the continents to the sea and that the fate of OC in lake sediments (burial vs. mineralization to carbon dioxide and methane) is highly sensitive to environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The Petit Saut Reservoir (French Guiana), flooded in 1994, has an anoxic and methane-rich ({\textgreater}400 $\mu$mol.L-1) hypolimnion and an oxycline located at around 5 meters depth. Waters passing through the turbines are enriched in CH4, which partly degasses downstream of the dam. Aerobic methane oxidation rates were measured in the waters of the reservoir epilimnion and, in river waters downstream of the dam, during the wet and dry seasons. A unique first order relationship between methane concentration (CCH4) and aerobic methane oxidation rates (CH4-ox) was found for the reservoir and the river downstream of the dam (CH4-ox = 0.11 ± 0.01 CCH4 + 1.18 ± 0.74) giving a specific CH4 oxidation rate of 0.11 ± 0.01 h-1. In the reservoir, depth-integrated methane oxidation rates were calculated from oxidation rates and the distributions of CH4 and oxygen and ranged between 11 ± 6 and 310 ± 132 mmol.m-2.d-1, consistent with the turbulent vertical flux from the hypolimnion (38-321 mmol.m-2.d-1) and almost two orders of magnitude higher than the atmospheric fluxes (0.3 ± 0.2-1.9 ± 1.2 mmol.m-2.d-1). The average integrated methane oxidation rate in the epilimnion given by these two independent methods is 100 ± 80 mmol.m-2.d-1. Downstream of the dam, about 40{\%} of the methane entering the river was oxidized (77 ± 40 mmol.m-2.d-1) and 50{\%} was emitted to the atmosphere (98 ± 28 mmol.m-2.d-1). Our results show that total pelagic oxidation (67 ± 64 Gg C-CH4.y-1) reduce atmospheric emissions by more than 85{\%} for the whole lake-river system and that this process is responsible for more than 25{\%} of total CO2 emissions from the whole reservoir-river system.

abstract = {The Mediterranean reservoirs receive frequent atmospheric Saharan dust inputs with soil-derived organic components mostly during the stratification periods, when run-off inputs are particularly limited. Here, we quantified and optically characterized the water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) of the (dry and wet) atmospheric deposition in collectors placed near three reservoirs from the western Mediterranean Basin. In addition, we determined the WSOC contribution to the pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the reservoirs and the influence of dust-derived chromophoric organic components on the water transparency during their stratification periods. We found synchronous dynamics in the WSOC atmospheric inputs among the three collectors and in the DOC concentrations among the three reservoirs. The DOC concentrations and the WSOC atmospheric inputs were positive and significantly correlated in the most oligotrophic reservoir (Qu{\'{e}}ntar) and in the reservoir with the highest ratio of surface area to mixing water depth (Cubillas). Despite these correlations, WSOC atmospheric inputs represented less than 10{\%} of the total DOC pool, suggesting that indirect effects of dust inputs on reservoir DOC may also promote these synchronous patterns observed in the reservoirs. Chromophoric components from dust inputs can significantly reduce the water transparency to the ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The depths where UVR at {\&}lambda; Combining double low line 320 nm was reduced to ten percent of surface intensity ( Z 10{\%}) decreased 27 cm in B{\'{e}}znar, 49 cm in Cubillas, and 69 cm in Qu{\'{e}}ntar due to the dust inputs. Therefore, the increasing dust export to the atmosphere may have consequences for the water transparency of aquatic ecosystems located under the influence of the global dust belt. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {Reservoirs are a globally significant source of methane (CH4), although most measurements have been made in tropical and boreal systems draining undeveloped watersheds. To assess the magnitude of CH4 emissions from reservoirs in midlatitude agricultural regions, we measured CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates from William H. Harsha Lake (Ohio, U.S.A.), an agricultural impacted reservoir, over a 13 month period. The reservoir was a strong source of CH4 throughout the year, emitting on average 176 ± 36 mg C m-2 d-1, the highest reservoir CH4 emissions profile documented in the United States to date. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the largest CH4 emissions were during summer stratified conditions, not during fall turnover. The river-reservoir transition zone emitted CH4 at rates an order of magnitude higher than the rest of the reservoir, and total carbon emissions (i.e., CH4 + CO2) were also greater at the transition zone, indicating that the river delta supported greater carbon mineralization rates than elsewhere. Midlatitude agricultural impacted reservoirs may be a larger source of CH4 to the atmosphere than currently recognized, particularly if river deltas are consistent CH4 hot spots. We estimate that CH4 emissions from agricultural reservoirs could be a significant component of anthropogenic CH4 emissions in the U.S.A.},

abstract = {We present a review of climate change projections over the Mediterranean region based on the most recent and comprehensive ensembles of global and regional climate change simulations completed as part of international collaborative projects. A robust and consistent picture of climate change over the Mediterranean emerges, consisting of a pronounced decrease in precipitation, especially in the warm season, except for the northern Mediterranean areas (e.g. the Alps) in winter. This drying is due to increased anticyclonic circulation that yields increasingly stable conditions and is associated with a northward shift of the Atlantic storm track. A pronounced warming is also projected, maximum in the summer season. Inter-annual variability is projected to mostly increase especially in summer, which, along with the mean warming, would lead to a greater occurrence of extremely high temperature events. The projections by the global and regional model simulations are generally consistent with each other at the broad scale. However, the precipitation change signal produced by the regional models shows substantial orographically-induced fine scale structure absent in the global models. Overall, these change signals are robust across forcing scenarios and future time periods, with the magnitude of the signal increasing with the intensity of the forcing. The intensity and robustness of the climate change signals produced by a range of global and regional climate models suggest that the Mediterranean might be an especially vulnerable region to global change. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {Ebullition (bubbling) from small lakes and ponds at high latitudes is an important yet unconstrained source of atmospheric methane (CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). Small water bodies are most abundant in permanently frozen peatlands, and it is speculated that their emissions will increase as the permafrost thaws. We made 6806 measurements of CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ebullition during four consecutive summers using a total of 40 bubble traps that were systematically distributed across the depth zones of three lakes in a sporadic permafrost landscape in northernmost Sweden. We identified significant spatial and temporal variations in ebullition and observed a large spread in the bubbles' CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} concentration, ranging from 0.04{\%} to 98.6{\%}. Ebullition followed lake temperatures, and releases were significantly larger during periods with decreasing atmospheric pressure. Although shallow zone ebullition dominated the seasonal bubble CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} flux, we found a shift in the depth dependency towards higher fluxes from intermediate and deep zones in early fall. The average daily flux of 13.4 mg CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} was lower than those measured in most other high-latitude lakes. Locally, however, our study lakes are a substantial CH {\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} source; we estimate that 350 kg of CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is released via ebullition during summer (June-September), which is approximately 40{\%} of total whole year emissions from the nearby peatland.

abstract = {Reservoirs account for about 10{\%} of the freshwater stored in lakes worldwide. These reservoirs are home to ‘reservoir ecosystems', that is, the aquatic and non-aquatic interactive ecosystems associated with artificial lakes where water is stored, typically behind a dam, for human purposes. While reservoir ecosystems provide various ecosystem services for sustainable development, their significance in research and policy has not been well understood and not well defined in the 2030 United Nation's (UN) Agenda for Sustainable Development. To advance understanding of reservoir ecosystems and their impact on policy, here we provide an overview of research on reservoir ecosystems and link it to UN SDGs and their Targets. Based on 5280 articles published in the last three decades, we applied network visualization to construct a framework for research addressing reservoir ecosystems. The framework covers four major themes: (1) ecosystem structure and function, (2) environmental pollution and stress effects, (3) climate impacts and ecological feedbacks, and (4) ecosystem services and management. We have found that sustainable reservoir ecosystems synergistically support 121 Targets of UN SDGs (71{\%} of all). Reservoir ecosystems have both negative and positive implications for 15 targets (9{\%}) and negative trade-offs for only 3 targets (2{\%}). Thirty SDG Targets (18{\%}) are unrelated to sustainable reservoir ecosystems. The synergies and trade-offs exist in three fields, securing basic material needs (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 14 and 15), pursuing common human well-being (SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10), and coordinating sustainable governance policies (SDGs 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17). Exploring these linkages allows better integration of reservoir ecosystems into the UN SDGs framework and guides sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems for sustainable development.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Methane (CH {\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} ) transport from organic-rich fine-grained (muddy) shallow aquatic sediments to water column is mediated dominantly by discrete bubbles, which is an important natural source of greenhouse CH {\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} . The lifespan of these bubbles within the sediment comprises two successive stages: growth from nucleation up to a mature size and then buoyant ascent toward the sediment–water interface. Bubbles often experience an oscillating overburden load due to the passage of winds and/or storm-induced short period surface waves or long-period tides, which can potentially affect both stages of the bubble's lifespan. However, little is known about the wave effects over bubble growth phase. In the present work, this subject is investigated using a numerical single-bubble mechanical/solute transport model, which quantifies the effects of different parameters (amplitude and period) of the wave loading and of the water depth, over the bubble growth pattern in sediments and its specific characteristics. It was found that bubbles induce early sediment fracturing in the presence of waves, attributed to the low overburden load appearing at wave troughs. Bubbles at shallow depth rapidly grow at wave troughs by inducing multiple intense fracturing events. However, this ability decreases with an increasing water depth because of a slower solute influx. In the presence of waves, bubbles mature in shorter time, whose contrast to the no wave case is controlled by the ratio of wave amplitude to equilibrium water depth. Due to the higher frequency of occurrence of wave troughs for shorter-period waves, bubble growth is accelerated compared with the case of longer-period waves. Overall, our modeling suggests that the fastest bubble growth can be predicted for higher amplitude, short-period waves traveling in shallow water. We further infer that accelerated bubble growth, along with subsequent wave-induced ascent can sufficiently shorten the bubble's total lifespan in sediment, which explains the observed episodic {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in situ{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ebullitions correlated with wind- or storm-induced waves. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The relation between productivity, O2 and organic carbon preservation has been the subject of great controversy. One theory has been that anoxic decomposition of organic matter is intrinsically slower than oxic decomposition and thus results in the accumulation of organic carbon in anoxic sediments and waters. However, several past studies suggest that differences in the intrinsic rates of decomposition between the two types of systems are small. Here, I provide further evidence of this by measuring microbial metabolism of individual radiolabeled compounds in the oxic and anoxic waters of stratified water bodies. The lack of a rate difference suggests the need for further explanation of the controls on carbon preservation. The concept is presented that anoxic sediments may sequester organic matter as bacterial biomass, or as bacterially derived products, in the absence of bacterial grazers. Thus, differences in the numbers and diversity of organisms that graze upon bacteria between oxic and anoxic sediments may explain part of the difference in carbon preservation rates that have been observed between the two types of systems. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

However, we experimentally and theoretically document that the presence of free gas in sediments can counteract this enhancement effect. The apparent diffusivities (Da) of Rhodamine WT and bromide in sediments containing 8-18{\%} gas (Da,YE) were suppressed by 7-39{\%} compared to the control (no gas) sediments (Da,C). The measured ratios of Da,YE:Da,C were well within the range of ratios predicted by a theoretical soil model for gas-bearing soils. Whereas gas voids in sediments reduce the Da for soluble species, they represent a shortcut for low-soluble species such as methane and oxygen. Therefore, the presence of even minor amounts of gas can increase the fluxes of low-soluble species (i.e., gases) by several factors, while simultaneously suppressing fluxes of dissolved species.

Although n-damo bacteria have been detected in a variety of freshwater lakes, their potential and distribution, and associated environmental factors, remain unclear. Therefore, the current study investigated the potential and distribution of anaerobic methanotrophs in sediments from Erhai Lake and Dianchi Lake, two adjacent freshwater lakes in the Yunnan Plateau with different trophic status. Both lakes showed active anaerobic methane oxidation potential and harbored a high density of n-damo bacteria. Based on the n-damo pmoA gene, sediment n-damo bacterial communities mainly consisted of Candidatus Methylomirabils oxyfera and Candidatus Methylomirabils sinica, as well as novel n-damo organisms. Sediment anaerobic methane oxidation potential and the n-damo bacterial community showed notable differences among seasons and between lakes. The environmental variables associated with lake trophic status (e.g. total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and total organic carbon) might have significant impacts on the anaerobic methane oxidation potential, as well as the abundance and community structure of n-damo bacteria.

abstract = {Rivers and marginal wetlands contribute significantly to the carbon (C) exchange rate per unit area compared to adjacent terrestrial ecosystems, due to high C inputs, metabolic activity and CO2 supersaturation. Within riverscapes, the contribution of emerging bottoms (i.e. parafluvial zones) and ephemeral vegetation (i.e. microphytobenthos or annual vascular plant communities) to the C metabolism is understudied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the CO2 exchange rates at the water- and emergent sand bar-atmosphere interfaces within a lowland large temperate river stretch. CO2 fluxes were measured seasonally, in summer (August 2007) and winter (March 2008) via static closed chambers, together with the primary producers' biomass (microphytobenthos and vascular macrophytes). Our results showed that the river was a CO2 source (between 0.2 and 7.6 mmol CO2 m−2 day−1), whilst the vegetated parafluvial zones acted as a net sink, with assimilation rates peaking at 623.4 mmol CO2 m−2 day−1. Emerging bare sediments were on the contrary net emitting CO2 systems (2.7–60.1 mmol CO2 m−2 day−1). Within lotic environments, seasonally emergent vegetated sand bars may represent important C fixation hot spots, with summer primary production particularly contributing to offsetting CO2 emissions and counterbalancing the heterotrophic metabolism of the saturated zones. Based on these outcomes, we suggest that studies addressing the strictly aquatic fluvial environment, which is generally a CO2 emitter, should be linked to those from transitional areas in order to better integrate terrestrial and aquatic C budgets.},

While dam building was stopped for a time, other indigenous approaches to water management, such as qanats (known for more than 3,000 years), surface ponds and underground small ponds for rain harvesting have been continuously used by farmers to date. The new era of dam building was begun in Iran in the mid 50s by international companies and has since remained the major approach to water supply. Yet dam building has affected the quantity and quality of water in watersheds, rivers and other water bodies, leading to noticeable destruction of natural habitats and species. Dam building has inundated forests in reservoirs, helped in timber smuggling upstream, and decreased forests downstream, thus accelerating desertification. The actual benefits of dams do not offset even a part of the costs incurred for construction, and their operation and maintenance. {\textcopyright} 2009 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Warming-induced changes in lake thermal and mixing regimes present risks to water quality and ecosystem services provided by U.S. lakes and reservoirs. Modulation of responses by different physical and hydroclimatic settings are not well understood. We explore the potential effects of climate change on 27 lake “archetypes” representative of a range of lakes and reservoirs occurring throughout the U.S. Archetypes are based on different combinations of depth, surface area, and water clarity. LISSS, a one-dimensional dynamic thermal simulation model, is applied to assess lake response to multiple mid-21st century change scenarios applied to nine baseline climate series from different hydroclimatic regions of the U.S. Results show surface water temperature increases of about 77 {\%} of increase in average air temperature change. Bottom temperature changes are less (around 30 {\%}) for deep lakes and in regions that maintain mid-winter air temperatures below freezing. Significant decreases in length of ice cover are projected, and the extent and strength of stratification will increase throughout the U.S., with systematic differences associated with depth, surface area, and clarity. These projected responses suggest a range of future challenges that lake managers are likely to face. Changes in thermal and mixing dynamics suggest increased risk of summer hypoxic conditions and cyanobacterial blooms. Increased water temperatures above the summer thermocline could be a problem for cold water fisheries management in many lakes. Climate-induced changes in water balance and mass inputs of nutrients may further exacerbate the vulnerability of lakes to climate change.},

abstract = {Tropical reservoirs have been identified as important methane (CH 4) sources to the atmosphere, primarily through turbine and downstream degassing. However, the importance of ebullition (gas bubbling) remains unclear. We hypothesized that ebullition is a disproportionately large CH 4 source from reservoirs with dendritic littoral zones because of ebullition hot spots occurring where rivers supply allochthonous organic material. We explored this hypothesis in Lake Kariba (Zambia/Zimbabwe; surface area {\textgreater}5000 km 2) by surveying ebullition in bays with and without river inputs using an echosounder and traditional surface chambers. The two techniques yielded similar results, and revealed substantially higher fluxes in river deltas (10 3 mg CH 4 m -2 d -1) compared to nonriver bays ({\textless}100 mg CH 4 m -2 d -1). Hydroacoustic measurements resolved at 5 m intervals showed that flux events varied over several orders of magnitude (up to 10 5 mg CH 4 m -2 d -1), and also identified strong differences in ebullition frequency. Both factors contributed to emission differences between all sites. A CH 4 mass balance for the deepest basin of Lake Kariba indicated that hot spot ebullition was the largest atmospheric emission pathway, suggesting that future greenhouse gas budgets for tropical reservoirs should include a spatially well-resolved analysis of ebullition hot spots. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Mesoscale climate model simulations using the Colorado State University Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (RAMS) projected that modifications to natural vegetation in the plains, primarily due to agriculture and urbanization, could produce lower summer temperatures in the mountains. We corroborate the RAMS simulations with three independent sets of data: (i) climate records from 16 weather stations, which showed significant trends of decreasing July temperatures in recent decades; (ii) the distribution of seedlings of five dominant conifer species in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, which suggested that cooler, wetter conditions occurred over roughly the same time period; and (iii) increased stream flow, normalized for changes in precipitation, during the summer months in four river basins, which also indicates cooler summer temperatures and lower transpiration at landscape scales. Combined, the mesoscale atmospheric/land-surface model, short-term trends in regional temperatures, forest distribution changes, and hydrology data indicate that the effects of land use practices on regional climate may overshadow larger-scale temperature changes commonly associated with observed increases in CO2 and other greenhouse gases.},

abstract = {We estimated carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions by diffusion, ebullition, and degassing in turbines from a semi-arid hydropower reservoir in northeastern Brazil. Sampling sites were allocated within the littoral and deeper waters of one embayment, the main-stream, and at turbines. Annual carbon emissions were estimated at 2.3 × 105 ± 7.45 × 104 t C year−1, or in CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq) at 1.33 × 106 ± 4.5 × 105 t CO2-eq year−1. Diffusion across the water surface was the main pathway accounting for 96{\%} of total carbon emissions. Ebullition was limited to littoral areas. A slight accumulation of CO2, but not of CH4, in bottom waters close to the turbines inlet led to degassing emissions about 8 × 103 t C year−1. Emissions in littoral areas were higher than in main-stream and contribute to 40{\%} of the total carbon. Carbon (C) emissions per electricity generated, at 60{\%} of installed capacity, is 0.05 t C-CO2-eq MWh−1. The ratio increases to 0.09 t C-CO2 MWh−1, equating 80{\%} of the emissions from natural gas and 40{\%} of diesel or coal power plants. Retention time and benthic metabolism were identified as main drivers for carbon emissions in littoral areas, while water column mixing and rapid water flow are important factors preventing CH4 accumulation and loss by degassing. Our results indicate that Itaparica Reservoir, located in the semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil, acts as a source of GHGs. Management measurements are needed to prevent emissions to raise in the future.},

abstract = {Among the important physical characteristics of a lake are whether it stratifies seasonally, and if so, the depth to which wind-mixing is limited by the stratification. It is generally known that sufficiently shallow lakes tend to remain isothermal throughout the year and that the depth of the thermocline in stratified lakes correlates positively with the surface area of the lake. Observations from lakes in several different regions of the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere show that whether a lake stratifies depends on both the maximum depth and the surface area of the lake, whereas the depth of the thermocline depends primarily on the surface area. A modification of previously published scaling arguments provides a plausible theoretical basis for some of this behavior. These arguments account for additional shear-induced mixing associated with the fundamental internal seiche in small lakes and with near-inertial motion in big lakes. For lakes of cross-basin diameter less than 5,000 m (surface area less than 25 km2), an estimate of the depth of the thermocline, h, at the time of maximum heat content is given by: h≅2.0 ($\tau$ g$\Delta$$\rho$) 1/2L 1/2 where $\tau$ is the wind stress associated with late summer storms, $\Delta$p is the density contrast between epilimnion and hypolimnion typical for lakes in that region near the time of maximum heat content, g is the gravitational acceleration, and L is the square root of the surface area of the lake.

abstract = {We measured in situ hypolimnion and metalimnion dinitrogen (N2) accumulation rates and N2 production from sediments in contact with the reservoir epilimnia for 3 small ({\textless} 1 km2) and shallow reservoirs with inherently low stratification stability. Hypolimnion areal denitrification rates ranged from 98.6 to 168 $\mu$mol N2-N m-2 h-1, while metalimnion rates were up to two times greater. A laboratory experiment simulating the temporary breakdown and reestablishment of the oxycline confirmed that short-term metalimnetic denitrification could be important in reactive nitrogen (N) loss in these reservoirs. Net denitrification occurred in sediments in contact with reservoir epilimnia during seasonal mixing, but net N2 fixation occurred in these sediments during stratification. The observed shift between net denitrification and net N2 fixation in epilimnetic sediments corresponded with an annual cycle of nitrate availability in the epilimnia. Annual whole-reservoir denitrification rates ranged from 12 to 23 g N m-2 yr-1. The hypolimnion contribution to annual denitrification was 16-25{\%}. Sediments in contact with epilimnia were the greatest N2 source in all of the reservoirs. However, denitrification in the anoxic metalimnion was of similar magnitude to denitrification in epilimnetic sediments at one reservoir, and variability in metalimnetic denitrification rates was related to the strength of stratification stability. Integrating habitat-specific measurements into whole-lake denitrification rates showed that hydrologically dynamic habitats represent important denitrification hotspots, and that periodic disturbances fuel hot moments for denitrification. {\textcopyright} 2012, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

A Critical Review of Methods for Analyzing Freshwater Eutrophication. Water 2021, 13, 225. Abstract: Water eutrophication is a global environmental problem that poses serious threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. The evaluation of eutrophication provides a theoretical basis and technical guidance for the management and rehabilitation of water ecosystems. In the last four decades, dozens of evaluation methods have been applied to freshwater eutrophication, but there is a clear need to optimize and standardize the most suitable methods. We have addressed this gap by presenting a systematic review of methodologies. Due to the diversity and complexity of water bodies, no single evaluation method was identified that would adequately represent eutrophication under all scenarios. We demonstrate that lakes can best be assessed using the trophic level index (TLI) method, reservoirs and wetlands the trophic state index (TSI) and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method, respectively, and rivers the FCE method or back propagation (BP) neural network methods. More recently applied methodologies including spectral imaging and 3-D mapping of water quality using underwater gliders allow greater resolution and can be effective in managing waterbodies to avoid future eutrophication. The aim of this review is to guide future studies on the most appropriate methods available for assessing and reporting water eutrophication.},

abstract = {Increased periods of prolonged droughts followed by severe precipitation events are expected throughout South America due to climate change. Freshwater sediments are especially sensitive to these changing climate conditions. The increased oscillation of water levels in aquatic ecosystems causes enhanced cycles of sediment drying and rewetting. Here we experimentally evaluate the effects of induced drought followed by a rewetting event on the release of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), and trace elements (iron, manganese, and zinc) from the sediment of a tropical reservoir in southeastern Brazil. Furthermore, we used bulb onions (Allium cepa) to assess the potential cytogenotoxicity of the water overlying sediments after rewetting. We found peaks in CO2 and CH4 emissions when sediments first transitioned from wet to dry, with fluxes declining as sediments dried out. CO2 emissions peaked again upon rewetting, whereas CH4 emissions remained unaltered. Our experiment also revealed average increases by up to a factor of {\~{}}5000 in the release rates of nutrients and trace elements in water overlying sediments after rewetting. These increased release rates of potentially toxic compounds likely explain the lower replication of Allium cepa cells (up to 22{\%} reduction) exposed to water overlying sediments after rewetting. Our findings suggest that increased events of drought followed by rewetting may lead to a range of changes in freshwater ecosystems, including nutrient enrichment, increased toxicity following resuspension of contaminants, and higher emission of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.},

Its best-known manifestations are toxic cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and waterways and proliferations of green macro algae in coastal areas. The term eutrophication is used by both the scientific community and public policy-makers, and therefore has a myriad of definitions. The introduction by the public authorities of regulations to limit eutrophication is a source of tension and debate on the activities identified as contributing or having contributed decisively to these phenomena. Debates on the identification of the driving factors and risk levels of eutrophication, seeking to guide public policies, have led the ministries in charge of the environment and agriculture to ask for a joint scientific appraisal to be conducted on the subject. Four French research institutes were mandated to produce a critical scientific analysis on the latest knowledge of the causes, mechanisms, consequences and predictability of eutrophication phenomena. This paper provides the methodology and the main findings of this two years exercise involving 40 scientific experts.},

abstract = {Reservoirs represent a key component of the global carbon cycle. However, estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from reservoirs remain poorly constrained due to the absence of spatially and temporally resolved measurements. We performed high-resolution monitoring of CO2 emissions (FCO2) in a semiarid hard-water reservoir to examine its seasonal and diel variability. Our results suggest that dissolved inorganic carbon input plays a central role in sustaining the surface water CO2 partial pressure (pCO2), which varies from 1076 to 4587 $\mu$atm. Although the reservoir is moderately to highly productive throughout the year, it is a net CO2 source with FCO2 values in the range of 308–1753 mg C m−2 d–1. This high CO2 efflux indicates that productive waters are not necessarily CO2 sinks. Both pCO2 and FCO2 exhibit clear seasonal and diel patterns. Surface water pCO2 is highest in March and presents a consistent diurnal/nocturnal pattern with the daytime pCO2 6–13{\%} lower than the nighttime pCO2. High CO2 efflux is observed during the ice-thaw period, indicating the release of CO2 that was accumulated during the winter. CO2 effluxes are typically higher during the nighttime driven by aquatic metabolism, but episodic weather events (e.g., rainfall and strong winds) can significantly enhance CO2 emissions and even reverse the diel pattern. Our study also shows that using only daytime measurements to estimate daily CO2 emissions would underestimate it by 9–25{\%}. Hence, future global assessments should incorporate CO2 emissions from hard-water reservoirs and account for their seasonal and diel variability.},

abstract = {Rivers transport both organic and inorganic carbon from their sources to the sea. Results of ∼800 organic and inorganic analyses from various British rivers of contrasting size and land use are presented here: (1) the headwater River Tern, a rural river of 852 km2 catchment; (2) the Ouseburn, a small urban 55 km2 catchment; (3) the River Tyne, a larger river system of ∼3000 km2 catchment; (4) a spatial survey from 205 sample sites on ∼60 rivers from SW England. We found that, with the exception of peat-rich headwaters, DIC concentration is always greater than DOC. DIC is primarily in the form HCO3-, with DIC concentrations highest in highly urbanised catchments, typically greater than those observed in catchments with carbonate bedrock, demonstrating a significant and previously unrecognised anthropogenic inorganic carbon input to urban rivers. {\textcopyright} The Author.

abstract = {Despite the increasing understanding of the magnitude and drivers of carbon gas emissions from inland waters, the relevance of water fluctuation and associated drying on their dynamics is rarely addressed. Here, we quantified CO2 and CH4 fluxes from a set of temporary ponds across seasons. The ponds were in all occasion net CO2 emitters irrespective of the presence or absence of water. While the CO2 fluxes were in the upper range of emissions for freshwater lentic systems, CH4 fluxes were mostly undetectable. Dry habitats substantially contributed to these emissions and were always a source of CO2, whereas inundated habitats acted either as a source or a sink of atmospheric CO2 along the year. Higher concentrations of coloured and humic organic matter in water and sediment were linked to higher CO2 emissions. Composition of the sediment microbial community was related both to dissolved organic matter concentration and composition, but we did not find a direct link with CO2 fluxes. The presence of methanogenic archaea in most ponds suggested the potential for episodic CH4 production and emission. Our results highlight the need for spatially and temporally inclusive approaches that consider the dry phases and habitats to characterize carbon cycling in temporary systems.},

With an estimated yearly amount of 12–29.6 Tg CH4 for reservoirs (Deemer et al., Bioscience 66:949–964, 2016) and up to 71.6 Tg CH4 for lakes (Bastviken et al., Science 331:50–50, 2011), they represent up to 10{\%} of total methane emissions and hence have to be taken into account in global budgets. Freshwater systems are emitting more methane than oceans although only covering about 3{\%} of the earth surface since methanogenesis, the building process of methane, is the main organic matter degradation step compared to oceans where sulfate reduction is dominant. Reservoirs in comparison to lakes have two additional methane release mechanisms, which are loss from methane-rich hypolimnion waters at the turbine and then degassing in the river to which the turbined water has been released. A still poorly constrained mechanism occurring in both systems is ebullition, the transfer of methane bubbles directly through the water column towards the atmosphere. Whereas in the oceans, mainly archaea often in a consortium with bacteria oxidize the methane in the sediments or water column, in freshwater systems the oxidation process seems to be much more versatile in respect to electron acceptors (oxygen, nitrate, iron, and manganese) as well as to the microorganisms involved. We believe that in the future there will be more discoveries and surprises when investigating freshwater methane oxidation.},

abstract = { Globally, inland waters emit over 2 Pg of carbon per year as carbon dioxide, of which the majority originates from streams and rivers. Despite the global significance of fluvial carbon dioxide emissions, little is known about their diel dynamics. Here we present a large-scale assessment of day- and night-time carbon dioxide fluxes at the water-air interface across 34 European streams. We directly measured fluxes four times between October 2016 and July 2017 using drifting chambers. Median fluxes are 1.4 and 2.1 mmol m −2 h −1 at midday and midnight, respectively, with night fluxes exceeding those during the day by 39{\%}. We attribute diel carbon dioxide flux variability mainly to changes in the water partial pressure of carbon dioxide. However, no consistent drivers could be identified across sites. Our findings highlight widespread day-night changes in fluvial carbon dioxide fluxes and suggest that the time of day greatly influences measured carbon dioxide fluxes across European streams. },

abstract = {Freshwater reservoirs are a significant source of CO2 to the atmosphere. CO2 is known to be emitted at the reservoir surface by diffusion at the air-water interface and downstream of dams or powerhouses by degassing and along the river course. In this study, we quantified total CO2 emissions from the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir (Lao PDR) in the Mekong River watershed. The study started in May 2009, less than a year after flooding and just a few months after the maximum level was first reached and lasted until the end of 2013. We tested the hypothesis that soils from the drawdown area would be a significant contributor to the total CO2 emissions. Total inorganic carbon, dissolved and particulate organic carbon and CO2 concentrations were measured in 4 pristine rivers of the Nam Theun watershed, at 9 stations in the reservoir (vertical profiles) and at 16 stations downstream of the monomictic reservoir on a weekly to monthly basis. CO2 bubbling was estimated during five field campaigns between 2009 and 2011 and on a weekly monitoring, covering water depths ranging from 0.4 to 16m and various types of flooded ecosystems in 2012 and 2013. Three field campaigns in 2010, 2011 and 2013 were dedicated to the soils description in 21 plots and the quantification of soil CO2 emissions from the drawdown area. On this basis, we calculated total CO2 emissions from the reservoir and carbon inputs from the tributaries. We confirm the importance of the flooded stock of organic matter as a source of carbon (C) fuelling emissions. We show that the drawdown area contributes, depending on the year, from 40 to 75{\%} of total annual gross emissions in this flat and shallow reservoir. Since the CO2 emissions from the drawdown zone are almost constant throughout the years, the large interannual variations result from the significant decrease in diffusive fluxes and downstream emissions between 2010 and 2013. This overlooked pathway in terms of gross emissions would require an in-depth evaluation for the soil organic matter and vegetation dynamics to evaluate the actual contribution of this area in terms of net modification of gas exchange in the footprint of the reservoir, and how it could evolve in the future.},

abstract = {The effect of dams on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) transport and riverine ecosystems is unclear in karst cascade reservoirs. Here, we analyzed water samples from a karst river system with seven cascade reservoirs along the Wujiang River, southwestern China, during one hydrological year. From upstream to downstream, the average concentration of DIC increased from 2.2 to 2.6 mmol/L and its carbon isotope composition ($\delta$13CDIC) decreased from −8.0 to −10‰. Meanwhile, the air temperature (Ta) increased from 20.3 °C to 26.7 °C and 10 °C to 13.7 °C in the warm and cold seasons, respectively. The results suggest that a cascade of dams has a stronger effect on DIC dynamics and retention than a single dam. The good correlation between Ta/HRT (hydraulic retention time) and $\Delta$[DIC] as well as $\Delta$[$\delta$13CDIC] mean that Ta and HRT affected the magnitude of the damming effect by altering changes in concentration of DIC and $\delta$13CDIC in the reservoir compared to the inflowing water. In particular, daily regulated reservoirs with short retention times acted more like river corridors and had a smaller effect on carbon dynamics, so modulating retention time might be used reduce the effect of dams on the riverine ecosystem.},

abstract = {The increased use of hydropower is currently driving the greatest surge in global dam construction since the mid-20th century, meaning that most major rivers on Earth are now dammed. Dams impede the flow of essential nutrients, including carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and silicon, along river networks, leading to enhanced nutrient transformation and elimination. Increased nutrient retention via sedimentation or gaseous elimination in dammed reservoirs influences downstream terrestrial and coastal environments. Reservoirs can also become hotspots for greenhouse gas emission, potentially impacting how ‘green' hydropower is compared with fossil-fuel burning. In this Review, we discuss how damming changes nutrient biogeochemistry along river networks, as well as its broader environmental consequences. The influences of construction and management practices on nutrient elimination, the emission of greenhouse gases and potential remobilization of legacy nutrients are also examined. We further consider how regulating hydraulic residence time and environmental flows (or e-flows) can be used in planning and operation from dam conception to deconstruction. River damming can harness hydropower, control flooding and store water, but can also alter biogeochemistry in reservoirs and downstream environments. In this Review, the impacts of dams on nutrient cycling and greenhouse production are discussed, emphasizing the need to consider biogeochemical cycling at all stages of dam lifespan.},

abstract = {We use high quality climate data from ground meteorological stations in the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and robust drought indices to confirm that drought severity has increased in the past five decades, as a consequence of greater atmospheric evaporative demand resulting from temperature rise. Increased drought severity is independent of the model used to quantify the reference evapotranspiration. We have also focused on drought impacts to drought-sensitive systems, such as river discharge, by analyzing streamflow data for 287 rivers in the IP, and found that hydrological drought frequency and severity have also increased in the past five decades in natural, regulated and highly regulated basins. Recent positive trend in the atmospheric water demand has had a direct influence on the temporal evolution of streamflows, clearly identified during the warm season, in which higher evapotranspiration rates are recorded. This pattern of increase in evaporative demand and greater drought severity is probably applicable to other semiarid regions of the world, including other Mediterranean areas, the Sahel, southern Australia and South Africa, and can be expected to increasingly compromise water supplies and cause political, social and economic tensions among regions in the near future. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

A total of 16 field campaigns were conducted from the summer stratification to fall turnover period in 2017. A random forest (RF) model was developed to estimate the pCO2 using concurrently measured water quality variables. The results showed that the vertical distribution of pCO2 and associated temporal variations of the NAF are closely related to the stratification strength of the reservoir. The reservoir surface pCO2 was supersaturated (1542 µatm) in summer (July 11), but this decreased to undersaturation as algae grew. Meanwhile, dissolved CO2 continuously accumulated below the reservoir mixed-layer due to the thermal stratification barrier and organic-rich floodwater intrusion. Vertical mixing began instantly as the stratification strength began to weaken in mid-October, and the surface pCO2 increased sharply up to 1934 µatm. Consequently, the NAF drastically increased to 3235 mg−CO2 m−2{\textperiodcentered}day−1, which implies that the NAF changes seasonally and large CO2 pulsing occurs during the turnover events. The results provide valuable information about pCO2 variability and physical mixing processes, as well as carbon budget estimation in stratified reservoirs, and offer an improved understanding of these phenomena.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Decades of conflicting results have fueled a debate about how O 2 affects organic matter (OM) degradation and carbon cycling. In a laboratory study, using both OM taken directly from a humic lake and chemically isolated fulvic acid, we monitored the mineralization of dissolved OM in freshwater under purely oxic and anoxic conditions, under oxic then anoxic conditions, and under anoxic then oxic conditions, for 426 d. Between 5{\%} and 24{\%} of the initial OM was mineralized, with most extensive mineralization occurring under purely oxic and anoxic-oxic conditions. A sequential change in the O2 regime did not result in greater overall degradation, but initially anoxic conditions favored subsequent oxic mineralization. A substantially greater fraction of the OM was degraded than in previous shorter studies, with as much as 50{\%} of the total OM degradation occurring after 147 d into the experiment. Three fractions of the degradable OM were identified: OM degraded only under oxic conditions (68-78{\%}), OM degraded more rapidly under anoxic conditions than under oxic conditions (16-18{\%}), and OM degraded at equal rates under both oxic and anoxic conditions (6-14{\%}). The degradation patterns of natural dissolved OM from a humic lake and chemically isolated fulvic acid were very similar, which indicates a similar level of bioavailability. The difference between anoxic and oxic degradation was greater in our long-term studies than in previous short-term experiments, which indicates that the oxic and anoxic degradation potentials vary with increasing overall OM recalcitrance and that similar oxic and anoxic degradation rates can be expected in short-term experiments in which {\textless}30{\%} of the long-term degradable OM is allowed to decompose.},

Direct measurements of eddy covariance CO2 fluxes from a large inland water body (Ross Barnett reservoir, Mississippi, USA) show that CO2 effluxes at night are approximately 70{\%} greater than those during the day. At longer time scales, frequent synoptic weather events associated with extratropical cyclones induce CO2 flux pulses, resulting in further increase in annual CO2 effluxes by 16{\%}. Therefore, CO2 emission rates from this reservoir, if these diel and synoptic processes are under-sampled, are likely to be underestimated by approximately 40{\%}. Our results also indicate that the CO2 emission rates from global inland waters reported in the literature, when based on indirect methods, are likely underestimated. Field samplings and indirect modeling frameworks that estimate CO2 emissions should account for both daytime-nighttime efflux difference and enhanced emissions during synoptic weather events. The analysis here can guide carbon emission sampling to improve regional carbon estimates.},

Little attention has been paid to the influence of variability in wind speed on the calculated gas transfer velocities and the possibility of chemical enhancement of CO2 exchange at low wind speeds over the ocean. The effect of these parameters is illustrated using a quadratic dependence of gas exchange on wind speed which is fit through gas transfer velocities over the ocean determined by the natural-14C disequilibrium and the bomb-14C inventory methods. -from Author},

It is process oriented and highlights the fascinating microorganisms that mediate anaerobic biogeochemistry. We begin this review with a brief discussion of CO2 assimilation by autotrophs, the source of most of the reducing power on Earth, and then consider the biological processes that harness this potential energy. Energy liberation begins with the decomposition of organic macromolecules to relatively simple compounds, which are simplified further by fermentation. Methanogenesis is considered next because CH4 is a product of acetate fermentation, and thus completes the catabolism of organic matter, particularly in the absence of inorganic electron acceptors. Finally, the organisms that use nitrogen, manganese, iron, and sulfur for terminal electron acceptors are considered in order of decreasing free-energy yield of the reactions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Reservoir drawdown areas—where sediment is exposed to the atmosphere due to water-level fluctuations—are hotspots for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, the global extent of drawdown areas is unknown, precluding an accurate assessment of the carbon budget of reservoirs. Here we show, on the basis of satellite observations of 6,794 reservoirs between 1985 and 2015, that 15{\%} of the global reservoir area was dry. Exposure of drawdown areas was most pronounced in reservoirs close to the tropics and shows a complex dependence on climatic (precipitation, temperature) and anthropogenic (water use) drivers. We re-assessed the global carbon emissions from reservoirs by apportioning CO2 and methane emissions to water surfaces and drawdown areas using published areal emission rates. The new estimate assigns 26.2 (15–40) (95{\%} confidence interval) TgCO2-C yr−1 to drawdown areas, and increases current global CO2 emissions from reservoirs by 53{\%} (60.3 (43.2–79.5) TgCO2-C yr−1). Taking into account drawdown areas, the ratio between carbon emissions and carbon burial in sediments is 2.02 (1.04–4.26). This suggests that reservoirs emit more carbon than they bury, challenging the current understanding that reservoirs are net carbon sinks. Thus, consideration of drawdown areas overturns our conception of the role of reservoirs in the carbon cycle. Globally, reservoirs are net emitters of carbon when drawdown areas are taken into account, according to an analysis of satellite observations of reservoir surface area.},

abstract = {Constraints on hypolimnetic methane production in productive lakes are of interest owing to the importance of methane emissions from lakes for the atmospheric methane burden. We studied carbon fluxes and terminal electron accepting processes in the hypolimnion of eutrophic Meerfelder Maar, Germany. Carbon fluxes from epilimnion and sediments were estimated using sediment traps, porewater analysis and incubation techniques. The contribution of various redox processes to overall dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production was quantified from a seasonal hypolimnetic mass balance. Carbon sedimentation rates were 22 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from the epilimnion and 20-34 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from the hypolimnion. Anaerobic respiration accounted for a DIC production of 21 mmol m(-2) d(-1), and was thus capable of using a substantial part of primary production. The diffusive C flux from the sediment was small in comparison, although potential respiration rates in incubation experiments reached 63 - 75 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Ebullition of methane occurred, but could not be quantified. Following depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate, iron and sulphate reduction and methanogenesis proceeded concurrently in the hypolimnion. Estimated hypolimnetic DIC production decreased in the order methanogenesis (2267 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} oxic respiration (880 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} sulphate reduction (575mmolm(-2)) {\textgreater} denitrification (159 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} acetogenesis (157 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} iron reduction (19 - 144 mmol m(-2)). Methane production thus dominated respiration and was not inhibited by sulphate and iron reduction. It also strongly accelerated with increased carbon sedimentation rates in September, which apparently eased limiting factors on the process. Hypolimnetic methane production is thus likely an important process in similar lakes, even in the presence of other electron acceptors, and will contribute to methane emissions during fall turnover.},

Yet, data on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from these sediments are too scarce to upscale emissions for global estimates or to understand their fundamental drivers. Here, we present the results of a global survey covering 196 dry inland waters across diverse ecosystem types and climate zones. We show that their CO2 emissions share fundamental drivers and constitute a substantial fraction of the carbon cycled by inland waters. CO2 emissions were consistent across ecosystem types and climate zones, with local characteristics explaining much of the variability. Accounting for such emissions increases global estimates of carbon emissions from inland waters by 6{\%} ({\~{}}0.12 Pg C y−1). Our results indicate that emissions from dry inland waters represent a significant and likely increasing component of the inland waters carbon cycle. Many inland waters seasonally or permanently dry up, thus exposing sediments to the atmosphere.

The direct approach, laboratory measurements made on intact sediment cores, yielded an average SOD rate of 1.68 ± 0.56 g O2 m-2 day-1. This was essentially equivalent to that determined indirectly by estimating the sediment flux of reduced chemical species (1.64 ± 0.14 g O2 m-2 day-1). The findings suggest that recovery of the oxygen resources of the lake will be mediated primarily through reductions in the delivery of particulate organic matter to be sediments and the rate at which in-place reserves of particulate organic matter are stabilized. The processes of algal respiration and aerobic mineralization of organic matter in the water column, which exhibit a more rapid response to remediation measures, will play a lesser role. -from Authors},

abstract = {Lakes hold much of Earth's accessible liquid freshwater, support biodiversity and provide key ecosystem services to people around the world. However, they are vulnerable to climate change, for example through shorter durations of ice cover, or through rising lake surface temperatures. Here we use a one-dimensional numerical lake model to assess climate change impacts on mixing regimes in 635 lakes worldwide. We run the lake model with input data from four state-of-the-art model projections of twenty-first-century climate under two emissions scenarios. Under the scenario with higher emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0), many lakes are projected to have reduced ice cover; about one-quarter of seasonally ice-covered lakes are projected to be permanently ice-free by 2080–2100. Surface waters are projected to warm, with a median warming across lakes of about 2.5 °C, and the most extreme warming about 5.5 °C. Our simulations suggest that around 100 of the studied lakes are projected to undergo changes in their mixing regimes. About one-quarter of these 100 lakes are currently classified as monomictic—undergoing one mixing event in most years— and will become permanently stratified systems. About one-sixth of these are currently dimictic—mixing twice per year—and will become monomictic. We conclude that many lakes will mix less frequently in response to climate change.},

abstract = {Net methane fluxes as well as methane fluxes via gas bubbles and via molecular diffusion were measured separately at nine different sampling sites throughout a beaver pond located in the low boreal forest region of central Ontario, Canada. In 1990, the average daily methane emission rate was 37.2 ± 30.4 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, yielding a total annual methane efflux of 5.8 g CH4 m-2 of which 1.1 g CH4 m-2 were produced in the wintertime when the pond was ice covered. On average, 65{\%} of the net methane flux was released via gas bubble emission, the remaining 35{\%} via molecular diffusion. Gas bubble flux rates were highly variable in space and time, suggesting that low sampling frequences, common in many methane emission studies, could introduce large uncertainties to the estimated annual flux rates for different wetland systems. The effects of changes in environmental variables on methane emissions were found to be strongly dependent on which transport mechanism dominated the release of methane from the sediments. While the gas bubble flux volume was mainly affected by changes in atmospheric pressure and sediment temperatures, the diffusive flux component was found to be more sensitive to changes in the pond water level. Overall, magnitudes of methane fluxes from this pond were similar to other beaver ponds and moderate to high when compared to other wetland types in the low boreal forest region.},

abstract = {Estimating carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission rates from reservoirs is important for regional and national greenhouse gas inventories. A lack of methodologically consistent data sets for many parts of the world, including agriculturally intensive areas of the United States, poses a major challenge to the development of models for predicting emission rates. In this study, we used a systematic approach to measure CO2 and CH4 diffusive and ebullitive emission rates from 32 reservoirs distributed across an agricultural to forested land use gradient in the United States. We found that all reservoirs were a source of CH4 to the atmosphere, with ebullition being the dominant emission pathway in 75{\%} of the systems. Ebullition was a negligible emission pathway for CO2, and 65{\%} of sampled reservoirs were a net CO2 sink. Boosted regression trees (BRTs), a type of machine learning algorithm, identified reservoir morphology and watershed agricultural land use as important predictors of emission rates. We used the BRT to predict CH4 emission rates for reservoirs in the U.S. state of Ohio and estimate they are the fourth largest anthropogenic CH4 source in the state. Our work demonstrates that CH4 emission rates for reservoirs in our study region can be predicted from information in readily available national geodatabases. Expanded sampling campaigns could generate the data needed to train models for upscaling in other U.S. regions or nationally.},

abstract = {Robust appraisals of climate impacts at different levels of global-mean temperature increase are vital to guide assessments of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The 2015 Paris Agreement includes a two-headed temperature goal: "holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C". Despite the prominence of these two temperature limits, a comprehensive overview of the differences in climate impacts at these levels is still missing. Here we provide an assessment of key impacts of climate change at warming levels of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, including extreme weather events, water availability, agricultural yields, sea-level rise and risk of coral reef loss. Our results reveal substantial differences in impacts between a 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming that are highly relevant for the assessment of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5 °C increase in global-mean temperature marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions. Similarly, this warming difference is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs. In a scenario with an end-of-century warming of 2 °C, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards. This fraction is reduced to about 90 {\%} in 2050 and projected to decline to 70 {\%} by 2100 for a 1.5 °C scenario. Analyses of precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences and hot-spots of change emerge. Regional reduction in median water availability for the Mediterranean is found to nearly double from 9 {\%} to 17 {\%} between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, and the projected lengthening of regional dry spells increases from 7 to 11 {\%}. Projections for agricultural yields differ between crop types as well as world regions. While some (in particular high-latitude) regions may benefit, tropical regions like West Africa, South-East Asia, as well as Central and northern South America are projected to face substantial local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize. Best estimate sea-level rise projections based on two illustrative scenarios indicate a 50 cm rise by 2100 relative to year 2000-levels for a 2 °C scenario, and about 10 cm lower levels for a 1.5 °C scenario. In a 1.5 °C scenario, the rate of sea-level rise in 2100 would be reduced by about 30 {\%} compared to a 2 °C scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of regional differentiation to assess both future climate risks and different vulnerabilities to incremental increases in global-mean temperature. The article provides a consistent and comprehensive assessment of existing projections and a good basis for future work on refining our understanding of the difference between impacts at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming.},

The objectives for this study were (1) to determine the partial pressures of carbon dioxide ($\rho$CO2) in the surface waters of a large sample of Florida lakes, (2) to determine if several limnological or geographic factors are related to levels of $\rho$CO2 in Florida lakes, and (3) to estimate the net annual rate of loss of CO2 to the atmosphere from the freshwater lakes of Florida. The calculated $\rho$CO2 for the lakes in our sample range from 0 to 81,000 $\mu$atm, with a mean of 3,550 $\mu$atm, a median of 1,030 $\mu$atm, and a geometric mean of 1,270 $\mu$atm. About 87{\%} of the Florida lakes were supersaturated with CO2. There were statistically significant correlations between values for $\rho$CO2 and several water chemistry variables; however, the R 2 values were small and accounted for only a small portion of the variance. In general the $\rho$CO2 values were higher in the lakes with low alkalinities and low contents of dissolved salts. The best predictor of $\rho$CO2 is pH, with an R 2 of 0.82 for a polynomial relationship. The $\rho$CO2 values tend to decrease from northwest to southeast across the state of Florida, which corresponds to the gradients we found for pH, alkalinity, and specific conductance. The average areal rate of carbon emission from the Florida lakes was 328 g C m-2 y-1, and the total carbon loss for the lakes and ponds of Florida was 2.0 Tg y-1. This amounts to about 2{\%} of the total carbon emissions from all the lakes of the world as estimated by previous studies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Freshwater reservoirs are significant components of the global carbon cycle. However, relatively few studies address the balance between the atmospheric carbon flux and sedimentation in these ecosystems. We performed a simultaneous analysis of the sedimentation fluxes of particulate organic carbon (SPOC) and atmospheric CO2 fluxes ((Formula presented.)) in the epilimnetic zone of two monomictic Mediterranean reservoirs. CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) was monitored hourly, and SPOC was measured at biweekly intervals with sediment traps during the stratification period. Both reservoirs were zones of intense organic carbon sedimentation and CO2 emission to the atmosphere despite having different trophic statuses. The positive relationship observed between SPOC and (Formula presented.) was likely due to the inputs of organic matter and nutrients to the epilimnion, which increased both sedimentation and CO2 emission. Nonetheless, the stronger effect on the sedimentation process led to a net downward flux of carbon in spite of the heterotrophic nature of both reservoirs.},

abstract = {Summer blooms of large, filamentous, nitrogen-fixing and potentially toxic cyanobacteria are characteristic of many productive, warm monomictic reservoirs in the Mediterranean region, where they constitute stable assemblages. The accumulation of positively buoyant cyanobacteria at the surface layers of the water column favours – among others – the interception of light, inorganic carbon and nitrogen fluxes from the atmosphere, giving these prokaryotes a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton groups. Cyanobacterial blooms can cause deleterious effects to water quality and reservoir ecosystem services. Although the structure of the plankton community in reservoirs during cyanobacterial blooms is a well-known limnological issue, few studies have been undertaken on its functional characteristics. In this study, we used a high-resolution autonomous monitoring system to investigate the short-term changes in gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP) and community respiration (R) in the near-surface waters of a Mediterranean reservoir during a dense summer cyanobacterial bloom. Our results demonstrate that during the bloom, the surface waters of the reservoir showed a well-balanced planktonic metabolism, with a mean GPP:R ratio not significantly different than 1 and therefore close positive correlations between GPP and R. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the daily integrated incident light and the NEP:GPP ratio, while the mixed-layer depth and NEP:GPP ratio were negatively correlated, suggesting a central role for physical processes in the control of community metabolism and the persistence of the cyanobacterial bloom. The implications for the bloom stability and relevance for reservoir water quality management are noted.},

abstract = {Lakes are a large source of CO2. An analysis of chemical and physical data from 5,118 boreal lakes reveals that a majority emit CO2 originating primarily from terrestrial sources rather than CO2 produced within the lakes. Annual CO2 emissions from lakes and other inland waters into the atmosphere are estimated to almost entirely compensate the total annual carbon uptake by oceans1,2,3. CO2 supersaturation in lakes, which results in CO2 emissions, is frequently attributed to CO2 produced within the lake4,5,6,7,8. However, lateral inorganic carbon flux through watersheds can also be sizeable9,10,11. Here we calculated lake surface water CO2 concentrations and emissions using lake pH, alkalinity and temperature from a compilation of data from 5,118 boreal lakes12. Autumn surface water CO2 concentrations and CO2 emissions from the 5,118 lakes co-varied with lake internal autumn CO2 production. However, using a mass balance approach we found that CO2 emission in the majority of lakes was sustained by inorganic carbon loading from the catchment rather than by internal CO2 production. Small lakes with high dissolved organic carbon and phosphorus concentrations, shorter retention times and longer ice-free seasons had the highest CO2 concentrations. CO2 emissions from these small lakes was twice that of comparable lakes in colder regions, and similar to emissions from subtropical and tropical lakes. We conclude that changes in land use and climate that increase dissolved inorganic carbon may cause emission levels from boreal lakes to approach those of lakes in warmer regions.},

abstract = {Water reservoirs are used for many purposes, such as water supply, irrigation, flood mitigation, and hydroelectric energy generation. Although hydroelectric energy is considered “green,” many studies show that the construction of a reservoir enhances greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the transformed area. These emissions, mainly of CO2, CH4, and N2O gases, depend on the age of the reservoir, landscape and soil composition, fauna and flora remnants of the impounded area, climatic conditions, and basin runoffs. Consequently, GHG emissions significantly vary between reservoirs and depending on local specificities. Several studies have investigated GHG emissions from reservoirs around the world, focusing mainly on reservoirs located in cold regions, temperate regions, and tropical regions. Research is lacking for reservoirs in Mediterranean countries, like Greece, and similar regions. This work initially assesses the net GHG emissions of a newly created reservoir (Ilarion est. 2012) in Western Macedonia, Greece. The methodology for net GHG emission calculation was based on the use of literature data concerning pre-impoundment emission factors and local specificities of the reservoir (terrain type, canopy cover), as well as on the 2-year measurement data that were collected using a “static floating chamber.” Furthermore, in this work, the gross GHG emissions of an older, in-line reservoir (Polyfytos est. 1974) were also calculated, based on 2-year measurement data. The results show that the global warming potential (GWP) of the reservoirs is dictated by methane emissions; it minimizes during winter and spring and maximizes during summer and autumn. Hydroelectric energy production at Ilarion Reservoir results in 32 to 97 times less total CO2 equivalent emissions in comparison to fossil fuels, while at Polyfytos Reservoir only 8 to 24 times less (based on gross emissions). It appears that the impact of a reservoir's morphology on GHG emissions is more significant than that of a reservoir's age.},

abstract = {The oxygen-consuming processes in the hypolimnia of freshwater lakes leading to deep-water anoxia are still not well understood, thereby constraining suitable management concepts. This study presents data obtained from 11 eutrophic lakes and suggests a model describing the consumption of dissolved oxygen (O 2) in the hypolimnia of eutrophic lakes as a result of only two fundamental processes: O 2 is consumed (i) by settled organic material at the sediment surface and (ii) by reduced substances diffusing from the sediment. Apart from a lake's productivity, its benthic O 2 consumption depends on the O 2 concentration in the water overlying the sediment and the molecular O 2 diffusion to the sediment. On the basis of observational evidence of long-term monitoring data from 11 eutrophic lakes, we found that the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate ranging from 0.47 to 1.31 g of O 2 m −2 d −1 (average 0.90 ± 0.30) is a function of (i) a benthic flux of reduced substances (0.37 ± 0.12 g of O 2 m −2 d −1) and (ii) an O 2 consumption which linearly increases with the mean hypolimnion thickness (z H) up to ∼25 m. This model has important implications for predicting and interpreting the response of lakes and reservoirs to restoration measures.},

In fact, some anthropogenic activities may influence the production of CH 4 from natural sources, such as lakes. 2. Ongoing changes in the catchment of lakes, including eutrophication and increased terrestrial organic carbon export, may affect CH 4 production rates as well as shape methanogen abundance and community structure. Therefore, inputs from catchments to lakes should be examined for their effects on CH 4 production. 3. We added algal and terrestrial carbon separately to lake sediment cores and measured CH 4 production. We also used quantitative polymerase chain reaction and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism to determine the effects of these carbon additions on methanogen abundance and community composition. 4. Our results indicate that CH 4 production rates were significantly elevated following the addition of algal biomass. Terrestrial carbon addition also appeared to increase methanogenesis rates; however, the observed increase was not statistically significant. 5. Interestingly, increased CH 4 production rates resulted from increases in per-cell activity rather than an increase in methanogen abundance or community compositional shifts, as indicated by our molecular analyses. 6. Overall, anthropogenic impacts on aquatic ecosystems can influence methanogenesis rates and should be considered in models of global methane cycling and climate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Thermal regime is strongly associated with hydrodynamics in water, and it plays an important role in the dynamics of water quality and ecosystem succession of stratified reservoirs. Changes in both climate and hydrological conditions can modify thermal regimes. Liuxihe Reservoir (23°45'50'N; 113°46'52'E) is a large, stratified and deep reservoir in Guangdong Province, located at the Tropic of Cancer of southern China. The reservoir is a warm monomictic water body with a long period of summer stratification and a short period of mixing in winter. The vertical distribution of suspended particulate material and nutrients are influenced strongly by the thermal structure and the associated flow fields. The hypolimnion becomes anoxic in the stratified period, increasing the release of nutrients from the bottom sediments. Fifty-one years of climate and reservoir operational observations are used here to show the marked changes in local climate and reservoir operational schemes. The data show increasing air temperature and more violent oscillations in inflow volumes in the last decade, while the inter-annual water level fluctuations tend to be more moderate. To quantify the effects of changes in climate and hydrological conditions on thermal structure, we used a numerical simulation model to create scenarios incorporating different air temperatures, inflow volumes, and water levels. The simulations indicate that water column stability, the duration of the mixing period, and surface and outflow temperatures are influenced by both natural factors and by anthropogenic factors such as climate change and reservoir operation schemes. Under continuous warming and more stable storage in recent years, the simulations indicate greater water column stability and increased duration of stratification, while irregular large discharge events may reduce stability and lead to early mixing in autumn. Our results strongly suggest that more attention should be focused on water quality in years of extreme climate variation and hydrological conditions, and selective withdrawal of deep water may provide an efficient means to reduce internal loading in warm years. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ebullition (bubbling) is an important mechanism for the transfer of methane (CH4) from shallow waters to the atmosphere. Because of their stochastic nature, however, ebullition fluxes are difficult to accurately resolve. Hydroacoustic surveys have the potential to significantly improve the spatiotemporal observation of emission fluxes, but knowledge of bubble size distribution is also necessary to accurately assess local, regional, and global water body CH4 emission estimates. Therefore, we explore the importance of bubble size and small-scale flux variability on CH4 transport in and emissions from a reservoir with a bubble-size-calibrated echosounder that can efficiently and economically survey greater areas while still resolving individual bubbles. Using a postprocessing method that resolves bubble density, we found that the largest 10{\%} of the {\textgreater}6700 observed bubbles were responsible for more than 65{\%} of the total CH4 transport. Furthermore, the asymmetry of CH4 ebullition flux distribution and the high spatial heterogeneity of those fluxes suggests that inadvertently omitting emission hot spots (i.e., areas of high flux) could lead to significant underestimations of CH4 emissions from localized areas and potentially from entire water bodies. While the bubble sizes resolved by the hydroacoustic method may provide insight into the factors controlling ebullition (e.g., sediment type, carbon sedimentation), the better resolution of small-scale CH4 emission hot spots afforded by hydroacoustics will bring us closer to the true CH4 emission estimates from all shallow waters, be them lakes, reservoirs, or coastal oceans and seas.},

abstract = {Droughts lead to falling river water levels and consequently expose river sediments. It is well known that from these exposed aquatic sediments, CO2 emits to the atmosphere, but upscaling of CO2 measurements from discrete point measurements to an entire river system remains challenging. Naturally occurring heterogeneous processes must be accounted for to obtain an overall CO2 flux and to assess its significance. We contribute to this challenge by incorporating a two stage scaling approach using in situ CO2 fluxes and remote sensing data. First, by combining optical airborne data with closed chamber measurements at a representative model site during a first scaling stage, we derive land cover type specific CO2 fluxes and identify distance to the water as the most suitable proxy for further upscaling. Second, we upscale derived spatial relations from the first scaling stage to the entire river system of the Elbe River using a satellite-based analysis. In this way, we derived area-weighted CO2 emissions from exposed river sediments of 56.6 ± 64.8 tC day−1 (corrected distance proxy) and 52.9 ± 44.6 tC day−1 (land cover proxy), respectively, for 1 day during the 2018 extreme drought. Given the intensification of droughts in terms of length and reoccurrence frequency, this result not only highlights the importance of drought-induced exposition of river sediment as a source of atmospheric CO2 but also underscores the ability to monitor CO2 emissions over an entire river system on a regular basis using remote sensing.},

abstract = {Methane emissions from lakes and reservoirs are a major natural source in the global budget of atmospheric CH4. A large fraction of these emissions are due to diffusive transport of CH4 from surface waters to the atmosphere. It was suggested recently that CH4 production in the oxic surface waters is required to compensate for diffusive CH4 emissions from lakes. In contrast, we demonstrate here that typical diffusive CH4-fluxes from sediments in shallow water zones, Fsed,S, suffice to explain CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. Our analysis is based on the combination of an exceptional data set on surface concentrations of CH4 with a mass balance model of CH4 that is focused on the surface mixed layer and considers CH4-fluxes from sediments, lateral transport, gas exchange with the atmosphere, and includes temperature dependencies of sediment fluxes and gas exchange. Fsed,S not only explains observed surface CH4 concentrations but also concentration differences between shallow and open water zones, and the seasonal variability of emissions and lateral concentration distributions. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that diffusive fluxes from shallow sediments and not oxic methanogenesis are the main source of the CH4 in the surface waters and the CH4 emitted from lakes and reservoirs.},

abstract = {We explore the role of lakes in carbon cycling and global climate, examine the mechanisms influencing carbon pools and transformations in lakes, and discuss how the metabolism of carbon in the inland waters is likely to change in response to climate. Furthermore, we project changes as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of lakes in the biosphere, and we revise the estimate for the global extent of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may be changed by human activities, including construction of impoundments, which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle, (2) their contribution to this cycle has significantly changed as a result of human activities, and (3) they will continue to change in response to future climate change causing decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases in the number of aquatic impoundments.},

abstract = {Three major reservoirs (Marne, Seine and Aube), situated in the upstream basin of the river Seine represent a storage capacity of 800 106 m3. In order to quantify the possible role of these reservoirs as a sink or source of nutrients and organic matter for the river system, an input/output mass-balance of suspended matter, organic carbon, inorganic nitrogen forms, phosphorus and reactive silica was established, providing reliable estimates of their retention/elimination and export. The study was carried out over 3 years (1993, 1994 and 1995) in differing hydrological conditions. The retention times varied from 0.3 to 0.8 year, depending on the reservoir and the year, but was longer in 1993 that was a drier year than 1994 and 1995, hydrologically quite similar. Regarding retention (or elimination) and export, the behaviour of the three studied reservoirs was similar. A clear loss or retention of nitrogen, phosphorus and silica was observed in the reservoirs and represented about 40{\%} of the incoming flux of nitrate, 50{\%} of silica, and 60{\%} of phosphate. The retention was lower for total phosphorus than for phosphate. The reservoirs are also sites of suspended matter deposition except during the decennial drawdown, when suspended matter is exported. For inorganic nitrogen, the average amount of nitrate retained in the Seine basin reservoirs upstream from Paris is 5000 tonnes y-1 that is almost equal to the estimated retention by deposition or denitrification in river channel sediments for the whole drainage network. The retention in the reservoirs represents about 12{\%} of the total flux of nitrate at the outlet of the basin upstream from Paris, and 5{\%} at the mouth of the Seine River. We also calculated inlake C, N, P, Si budgets on the basis of direct process measurements. Measurements of planktonic primary and bacterial activity production led to annual net production of 4200 and 580 tonnes of carbon, respectively. A reasonable value (450 tonnes of carbon) of grazing was calculated. Corresponding N, P, Si fluxes were drawn from appropriate C:N:P:Si ratios. Benthic fluxes were measured with bell jars. The retention of P and Si represents a small fraction of important internal fluxes of phytoplanktonic uptake and recycling, while inorganic nitrogen retention depends mostly on benthic denitrification. The behaviour of P and Si differs in that P is mainly recycled in the water column, while Si dissolution occurs at the sediment interface. Nitrogen is recycled in both the planktonic and the benthic phase.},

abstract = {The change in the stratification pattern in Boadella Reservoir (Catalonia, Spain) due to the switch in water withdrawal was investigated for a 6-month period in the year 2000. A numerical one-dimensional model (DLM) was used to predict the thermal structure of the reservoir during the period of maximum water demand. The model was found to satisfactorily predict the basic trends of the thermal stratification of the water column of the reservoir. We used this model to investigate various possible water withdrawal scenarios. When thermal stratification has been completely developed, the location of the main thermocline coincides with the depth of the outlet, in the various withdrawal scenarios considered. The possible effect of the switch between outlets on the water quality of the reservoir is discussed.},

abstract = {Despite significant contributions of inland lakes to the global methane cycle, we lack a process-based understanding of what regulates inter-lake variation in methane emissions. Previous comparative work has identified a potential link between lake primary productivity and methane emissions; also, lab-scale experiments suggest that the addition of algal substrate to anoxic sediments rapidly enhances rates of methanogenesis. This existing work indicates that primary productivity could enhance lake contributions to the global methane cycle. However, a more systematic investigation of the links between lake primary production, methanogenesis, and methane emission to the atmosphere is required to quantify the implications of increased cultural eutrophication for methane evasion from lakes. Using paired measurements of methanogenesis and methane emissions on 16 north temperate lakes, we documented a positive relationship between lake productivity and sediment methanogenesis rates. However, increased methanogenesis rates did not result in an increase in diffusive methane emissions. Rather, they generated greater methane storage during summer stratification and enhanced methane emission to the atmosphere via bubbling (ebullition), dependent on site depth. Ebullition most frequently occurred at sites less than 6 m deep and where methanogenesis rates were high. The relationships between lake productivity, methanogenesis, and depth-dependent ebullition suggests it is likely that shallow, productive lakes contribute significantly more methane to the atmosphere than deep, clear lakes and will continue to do so in light of the growing prevalence of lake eutrophication.},

abstract = {Human population growth has increased the demand for water and clean energy, leading to the massive construction of reservoirs. Reservoirs can emit greenhouse gases (GHG) affecting the atmospheric radiative budget. The radiative forcing due to CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions and the relative contribution of each GHG in terms of CO2 equivalents to the total forcing is practically unknown. We determined simultaneously the CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes in reservoirs from diverse watersheds and under variable human pressure to cover the vast idiosyncrasy of temperate Mediterranean reservoirs. We obtained that GHG fluxes ranged more than three orders of magnitude. The reservoirs were sources of CO2 and N2O when the watershed lithology was mostly calcareous, and the crops and the urban areas dominated the landscape. By contrast, reservoirs were sinks of CO2 and N2O when the watershed lithology was predominantly siliceous, and the landscape had more than 40{\%} of forestal coverage. All reservoirs were sources of CH4, and emissions were determined mostly by reservoir mean depth and water temperature. The radiative forcing was substantially higher during the stratification than during the mixing. During the stratification the radiative forcings ranged from 125 mg CO2 equivalents m-2 d-1 to 31 884 mg CO2 equivalents m-2 d-1 and were dominated by the CH4 emissions; whereas during the mixing the radiative forcings ranged from 29 mg CO2 equivalents m-2 d-1 to 722 mg CO2 equivalents m-2 d-1 and were dominated by CO2 emissions. The N2O contribution to the radiative forcing was minor except in one reservoir with a landscape dominated by crops and urban areas. Future construction of reservoirs should consider that siliceous bedrocks, forestal landscapes, and deep canyons could minimize their radiative forcings.},

abstract = {Methanogenesis has traditionally been assumed to occur only in anoxic environments, yet there is mounting, albeit indirect, evidence of methane (CH4) production in oxic marine and freshwaters. Here we present the first direct, ecosystem-scale demonstration of methanogenesis in oxic lake waters. This methanogenesis appears to be driven by acetoclastic production, and is closely linked to algal dynamics. We show that oxic water methanogenesis is a significant component of the overall CH4 budget in a small, shallow lake, and provide evidence that this pathway may be the main CH4 source in large, deep lakes and open oceans. Our results challenge the current global understanding of aquatic CH4 dynamics, and suggest a hitherto unestablished link between pelagic CH4 emissions and surface-water primary production. This link may be particularly sensitive to widespread and increasing human influences on aquatic ecosystem primary productivity.},

abstract = {Rates of methanogenesis in freshwater sediments have been shown to increase with inputs of phytoplankton biomass. Although many studies have shown the importance of resource quality for decomposition, little is known of the importance of substrate quality on rates of methanogenesis. Here, we studied the effects of lipid content and taxonomic affiliation of phytoplankton biomass on rates of methanogenesis in lake sediment slurries from five lakes differing in trophic status. Substrate quantity had a positive effect on methanogenesis despite differing trophic status. Furthermore, we observed that phytoplankton biomass quality, in terms of lipid content, enhanced methanogenesis rates. However, rates of methanogenesis between lake sediments treated with Scenedemus obliquus or Microcystis aeruginosa did not differ when lipid content was held constant. Phytoplankton lipid content has been shown to increase when nutrients are limiting, which may result in an increase in substrate quality for methanogenesis with eutrophication. However, our study revealed that responses of substrate quantity to nutrient enrichment likely outpace the effects of resource quality and may result in a net increase in CH4 emissions from eutrophied lakes. Interestingly, the resource quality feedback may at least partially reduce the potential effect of eutrophication on lake methanogenesis.},

@article{Harrison2017,
abstract = {Water-level fluctuations due to reservoir management could substantially affect the timing and magnitude of reservoir methane (CH4) fluxes to the atmosphere. However, effects of such fluctuations on CH4 emissions have received limited attention. Here we examine CH4 emission dynamics in six Pacific Northwest U.S. reservoirs of varying trophic status, morphometry, and management regimes. In these systems, we show that water-level drawdowns can, at least temporarily, greatly increase per-area reservoir CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, and can account for more than 90{\%} of annual reservoir CH4 flux in a period of just a few weeks. Reservoirs with higher epilimnetic [chlorophyll a] experienced larger increases in CH4 emission in response to drawdown (R2 = 0.84, p {\textless} 0.01), suggesting that eutrophication magnifies the effect of drawdown on CH4 emission. We show that drawdowns as small as 0.5 m can stimulate ebullition events. Given that drawdown events of this magnitude are quite common in reservoirs, our results suggest that this process must be considered in sampling strategies designed to characterize total CH4 fluxes from reservoirs. The extent to which (and the mechanisms by which) drawdowns short-circuit connections between methanogenesis and methanotrophy, thereby increasing net CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, should be a focus of future work.

abstract = {1.We analysed 41 years of data (1968-2008) from Blelham Tarn, U.K., to determine the consequences of eutrophication and climate warming on hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO). 2.The establishment of thermal stratification was strongly related to the onset of DO depletion in the lower hypolimnion. As a result of a progressively earlier onset of stratification and later overturn, the duration of stratification increased by 38±8days over the 41years. 3.The observed rate of volumetric hypolimnetic oxygen depletion (VHOD obs) ranged from 0.131 to 0.252gO 2m -3 per day and decreased significantly over the study period, despite the increase in the mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in the growing season. The vertical transport of DO represented from 0 to 30{\%} of VHOD obs, while adjustments for interannual differences in hypolimnetic temperature were less important, ranging from -11 to 9{\%} of VHOD obs. 4.The mean wind speed during May made the strongest significant contribution to the variation in VHOD obs. VHOD obs adjusted for the vertical transport of DO and hypolimnetic temperature differences, VHOD adj, was significantly related to the upper mixed layer Chl a concentration during spring. 5.Hypolimnetic anoxia (HA) ranged from 27 to 168days per year and increased significantly over time, which undoubtedly had negative ecological consequences for the lake. 6.In similar small temperate lakes, the negative effects of eutrophication on hypolimnetic DO are likely to be exacerbated by changes in lake thermal structure brought about by a warming climate, which may undermine management efforts to alleviate the effects of anthropogenic eutrophication. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

There were large temporal variations for CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} fluxes, ranging from - 1.7 to 131 mg CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} h{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, in the macrophyte-covered littoral zone. The highest CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emissions occurred during the period of the summer algal bloom. The amount of CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} flux from June to September accounted for about 50-90{\%} of the annual fluxes.

abstract = {We investigated the role of lake sediments as carbon (C) source and sink in the annual C budget of a small (0.07 km2) and shallow (mean depth, 3.4 m), humic lake in boreal Sweden. Organic carbon (OC) burial and mineralization in the sediments were quantified from 210Pb-dated sediment and laboratory sediment incubation experiments, respectively. Burial and mineralization rates were then upscaled to the entire basin and to one whole year using sediment thickness derived from sub-bottom profiling, basin morphometry, and water column monitoring data of temperature and oxygen concentration. Furthermore, catchment C import, open water metabolism, photochemical mineralization as well as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions to the atmosphere were quantified to relate sediment processes to other lake C fluxes. We found that on a whole-basin and annual scale, sediment OC mineralization was three times larger than OC burial, and contributed about 16{\%} to the annual CO2 emission. Other contributions to CO2 emission were water column metabolism (31{\%}), photochemical mineralization (6{\%}), and catchment imports via inlet streams and inflow of shallow groundwater (22{\%}). The remainder (25{\%}) could not be explained by our flux calculations, but was most likely attributed to an underestimation in groundwater inflow. We conclude that on an annual and whole-basin scale (1) sediment OC mineralization dominated over OC burial, (2) water column OC mineralization contributed more to lake CO2 emission than sediment OC mineralization, and (3) catchment import of C to the lake was greater than lake-internal C cycling.},

This dataset includes 1113 complete and homogeneous monthly precipitation time series from the Mediterranean Iberian Peninsula (IP), and corresponds to the five official Spanish hydrological divisions which drain into the Mediterranean Sea. The time series of annual and seasonal precipitation were used to test for trends. The absolute value of the anomaly time series was also tested for trends to identify changes in interannual variability of precipitation. The significance of these changes was assessed using the non-parametric Spearman rank test. The intensities of observed changes, both on mean values and variability, were estimated by using linear regression techniques. Finally, we analysed the area affected by different trends by using raster maps and spatial statistics, in addition to calculating the global balances for the five hydrological divisions. We detected high variability in precipitation regimes and conditions in the study area; nevertheless, a decrease in seasonal and annual precipitation has predominated in the east of the IP during the second half of the 20th century. On an annual scale, precipitation has diminished over 90.1{\%} of the study area. Additionally, a high percentage of the territory was affected by diminishing precipitation at a seasonal level: 85{\%} (of territory) in summer, 82{\%} in spring, 64{\%} during winter and 61{\%} in autumn. Taking the study area as a whole, seasonal precipitation decreases are ranked as follows: summer (-22.5{\%}), spring (-19.3{\%}), winter (-7.3{\%}), and autumn (-5.2{\%}), with a decrease in the value of the global mean annual precipitation -12.4{\%}. We also detected an increase of precipitation variability in winter (+23.5{\%}) and summer (+11.4{\%}), and a decrease in autumn and spring (-14.9 and -16.8{\%}, respectively) with a global mean value of +7.8{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2008 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Carbon balances were calculated for the summer stratification period of 2001 for the hydroelectric reservoir L. Skinnmuddselet (created in 1989) and the natural L. {\"{O}}rtr{\"{a}}sket, and estimated on annual basis for both lakes. The reservoir and the lake have similar chemical characteristics and are located in adjacent catchments in the northern part of Sweden. Our main hypothesis was that the CO2 production and emissions from the reservoir, L. Skinnmuddselet, would be greater than in the natural L. {\"{O}}rtr{\"{a}}sket, due to the decomposition of flooded vegetation and peat. The carbon balances showed that the total production of CO2 per unit lake surface area during the summer was very similar in the natural lake and the reservoir (31.3gCm-2 in L. {\"{O}}rtr{\"{a}}sket and 25.3gCm -2 in L. Skinnmuddselet). The sediments were the major CO 2 source in the reservoir, while most of the mineralization in the natural lake occurred in the water column. On annual basis the natural L. {\"{O}}rtr{\"{a}}sket produced and emitted more CO2 per unit of lake surface area than the reservoir L. Skinnmuddselet since mineralization proceeded during winter when L. Skinnmuddselet was emptied for electricity production. Therefore, the potential for CO2 emission was not greater in the reservoir than in the natural lake. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The production, oxidation, and transport of methane (CH4) from a boreal beaver pond were measured during the ice-free period in order to explain the observed flux of CH4 between the pond and the atmosphere. The study pond was located in the northern study area (NSA) of the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), near Thompson, Manitoba. Three pathways transported the CH4 produced in the rich, organic anaerobic sediments. In order of importance they were: bubble flux (ebullition), diffusion, and plant transport. The water-air flux of CH4 was related to windspeed and sediment temperature, whereas the bubble flux also showed a degree of synchronicity with changes in atmospheric pressure and water level. By mid-June the storage of CH4 in the sediments reached a quasi steady-state, and production minus oxidation approximated the water-air exchange. Since the dominant pathway of ebullition is little affected by oxidation, the mean unit area flux of CH4 for the vegetated and open portions of the beaver pond (155 and 320 mg CH4 m-2day-1) were larger than the flux observed in most wetlands of the NSA. CH4 in bubbles from vegetated sites was significantly enriched in 13C and significantly depleted in 2H relative to bubbles from open water sites, consistent with a shift in methane production mechanism from acetate fermentation to CO2 reduction for the vegetated and unvegetated sites, respectively. The radiocarbon content of methane was not different between the two types of sites (114.7 ± 4.2pMC, vegetated versus 108.1±6.5pMC, open water).},

abstract = {Lakes are major sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere that contribute significantly to the global budget. Recent studies have shown that diffusive fluxes, ebullition and surface water CH4 concentrations can differ significantly within lakes—spatially and temporally. CH4 fluxes may be affected at longer scales in response to seasons, temperature, lake mixing events, short term weather events like pressure variations, shifting winds and diel cycles. Frequent measurements of fluxes in the same system and integrated assessments of the impacts of the spatio-temporal variability are rare. Thereby, large scale assessments frequently lack information on this variability which can potentially lead to biased estimates. In this study, we analysed the variability of CH4 fluxes and surface water CH4 concentrations across open water areas of lakes in a small catchment in southwest Sweden over two annual cycles. Significant patterns in CH4 concentrations, diffusive fluxes, ebullition and total fluxes were observed in space (between and within lakes) and in time (over diel cycles to years). Differences observed among the lakes can be associated with lake characteristics. The spatial variability within lakes was linked to depth or distance to stream inlets. Temporal variability was observed at diel to seasonal scales and was influenced by weather events. The fluxes increased exponentially with temperature in all three lakes, with stronger temperature dependence with decreasing depth. By comparing subsets of our data with estimates using all data we show that considering the spatio-temporal variability in CH4 fluxes is critical when making whole lake or annual budgets.},

However on a watershed basis, in-lake ANC generation was minor ({\textless}5{\%}) due to the short hydraulic retention time of Dart's Lake.

Already subtle variations in the timing of stratification onset and break-up (phenology) are known to have major ecological effects, mainly by determining the availability of light, nutrients, carbon and oxygen to organisms. Despite its ecological importance, historic and future global changes in stratification phenology are unknown. Here, we used a lake-climate model ensemble and long-term observational data, to investigate changes in lake stratification phenology across the Northern Hemisphere from 1901 to 2099. Under the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario, stratification will begin 22.0 ± 7.0 days earlier and end 11.3 ± 4.7 days later by the end of this century. It is very likely that this 33.3 ± 11.7 day prolongation in stratification will accelerate lake deoxygenation with subsequent effects on nutrient mineralization and phosphorus release from lake sediments. Further misalignment of lifecycle events, with possible irreversible changes for lake ecosystems, is also likely.},

abstract = {The differential impact of microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis on the mineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC) in warm monomictic Lake Kinneret (LK), Israel was studied during three consecutive lake cycles. The hypolimnetic accumulation of total sulfide and dissolved methane was examined in relation to the physical forcing of the water column and the settling flux of particulate matter. With the on-set of thermal stratification in spring, both solutes increased concomitantly with the depletion of oxygen, first in the benthic boundary layer, followed by the upper hypolimnion. Methane production was restricted to the sediments as emphasized by the persistently linear concentration gradient in the hypolimnion. Sulfate reduction occurred both in the sediments and the water column as revealed by the hypolimnetic distribution of sulfide and recurring metalimnetic sulfide peaks. Annual differences in the accumulation pattern of both solutes appeared to be primarily linked to the settling flux of POC and the length of the stratified season. Relatively lower hypolimnetic concentrations of dissolved methane during the stratified season of 2000 coincided with increased ebullition of gaseous methane, likely as the result of a nearly a 2 m drop in the lake level. Overall, sulfate reduction accounted for more than 60{\%} of the POC settling flux, a finding that differs from similar studies made in temperate lakes where methanogenesis was shown to be the primary mode of terminal carbon mineralization. Intensive organic carbon turnover at the sediment water interface and comparatively high sulfate concentrations in LK are the most likely reason. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Because hydrography is one of the most important drivers in nutrient transport, it was essential to establish how climatic changes and direct human activities (primarily irrigation and reservoir operations) affect the hydrological cycle. Contemporary and future hydrography was established by applying a modified version of a global water balance and transport model (WBMplus) driven by present and future climate forcing, as described in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios (1970–2050). WBMplus represents a major upgrade to previous WBM implementations by incorporating irrigational water uptake and reservoir operations in a single modeling framework. Contemporary simulations were carried out by using both observed climate forcings from the Climate Research Unit of East Anglia (CRU) data sets and from Global Circulation Model (GCM) simulations that are comparable to the future simulations from the same GCM forcings. Future trends in three key human activities (land use, irrigation, and reservoirs operation for hydropower) were taken from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE). The reservoir operation required establishing a realistic distribution of future reservoirs since the IMAGE model provided only the hydropower potentials for the different future scenarios.},

abstract = {Sediment organic carbon (C) burial and CO2 fluxes in inland waters are quantitatively important in regional and global carbon budgets. Estimates of C fluxes from inland waters are typically based on limited temporal resolution despite potential large variations with season and weather events. Further, most freshwater C budget studies have focused on natural soft-water lakes, while reservoirs and hard-water systems are globally numerous. Our study quantifies C fluxes in two hard-water, human constructed reservoirs (Ohio, USA) of contrasting watershed land use (agriculture vs. forest) using high-resolution mass balance budgets. We show that during a dry summer, C retention and export via the dam were reduced compared to a wet summer. Both reservoirs were net CO2 sources during a wet summer, but CO2 sinks during a dry summer. Despite weather-related summer differences, annual C fluxes within each reservoir were similar between years. Both reservoirs appear to be net autotrophic despite often being CO2 sources based on budgets. This is likely because CO2 fluxes in our hard-water reservoirs were more strongly associated with DIC than DOC. Using our C fluxes and statewide watershed land use, we determined the regional importance of Ohio reservoirs in OC burial and CO2 emissions. We estimate that Ohio reservoirs bury up to 4 times more OC, but emit {\textless}25{\%} of CO2, than predicted based on their area and recent global mean estimates in lentic ecosystems. Our results provide evidence that moderately old ({\~{}}50 years), temperate hard-water reservoirs are important OC sinks but contribute little to CO2 emissions. {\textcopyright}2013.

abstract = {Water scarcity severely impairs food security and economic prosperity in many countries today. Expected future population changes will, in many countries as well as globally, increase the pressure on available water resources. On the supply side, renewable water resources will be affected by projected changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and other climate variables. Here we use a large ensemble of global hydrological models (GHMs) forced by five global climate models and the latest greenhouse-gas concentration scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways) to synthesize the current knowledge about climate change impacts on water resources. We show that climate change is likely to exacerbate regional and global water scarcity considerably. In particular, the ensemble average projects that a global warming of 2 °C above present (approximately 2.7 °C above preindustrial) will confront an additional approximate 15{\%} of the global population with a severe decrease in water resources and will increase the number of people living under absolute water scarcity ({\textless}500 m3 per capita per year) by another 40{\%} (according to some models, more than 100{\%}) compared with the effect of population growth alone. For some indicators of moderate impacts, the steepest increase is seen between the present day and 2 °C, whereas indicators of very severe impacts increase unabated beyond 2 °C. At the same time, the study highlights large uncertainties associated with these estimates, with both global climate models and GHMs contributing to the spread. GHM uncertainty is particularly dominant in many regions affected by declining water resources, suggesting a high potential for improved water resource projections through hydrological model development.},

Model domain is centered in the Mediterranean basin, considered one of the most sensitive areas regarding to global warming and future climate extreme conditions. This study is based on objective indices to describe extreme climate events of maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation. The statistical frequency and persistence of cold spells, heat waves and intense rain days simulated in the current climate run are compared against the ones resulting from future scenario numerical experiment. Description of extreme processes in both intensity and frequency give a different and complementary overview of extreme events changes in future climate conditions for any of the magnitudes analyzed. In fact, a common feature obtained from the results is the absence of correlation between both magnitudes, as much as for temperatures as for precipitation. Results also point to the usefulness of very high-resolution models (RCM) to study extreme events, due to the great spatial variability obtained in any of the variables studied. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Temporal scales of variability for the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the surface waters of two stratified Mediterranean reservoirs were examined through the temporal decomposition of 5month time series with hourly sampling frequency. pCO2 time series included similar patterns of variability at daily, biweekly, and seasonal scales regardless of the difference in amplitude of the pCO2 variation in the two reservoirs studied. Daily variability was strongly related to the day-night cycles of metabolic activity, accounting for about one third of the total amplitude in pCO2 variation. At a biweekly scale, wind forcing led to higher rates of air-water CO2 exchange and subsequently temporary partial mixing events associated to relevant increase of CO 2 concentration in surface waters. Seasonal variability accounted for one third of the amplitude of the pCO2 variability and was coupled to the seasonal dynamics of water temperature and thermal stratification of the water column. Our results provide evidence that CO2 emission from stratified water bodies shows significant variability at daily, biweekly, and seasonal scales; all of which should be taken into consideration in the analyses of the carbon fluxes. The wind-induced mixing events, operating at temporal scales between daily and seasonal cycles, may become a major factor controlling the pCO2 dynamics. Hence, some of the most common models for computing CO2 fluxes from pCO2 were not able to reproduce the biweekly response patterns of CO2 emissions to wind forcing. {\textcopyright}2014.

abstract = {Subtropical reservoirs are an important source of atmospheric methane (CH4). This study investigated the spatiotemporal variability of bubble and diffusive CH4 emissions from a subtropical reservoir, including its upstream and downstream rivers, in eastern China. There was no obvious seasonal variation in CH4 emissions from the main reservoir, which increased slightly from the first half year to the next half year. In the upstream river, CH4 emissions were low from February to June and fluctuated widely from July to January due to bubble activity. In the downstream river, CH4 emissions were lowest in February, which was possibly influenced by the low streamflow rate from the reservoir (275 m3 s−1) and a short period of mixing. There was spatial variability in CH4 emissions, where fluxes were highest from the upstream river (3.65 ± 3.24 mg CH4 m−2 h−1) and lowest from the main reservoir (0.082 ± 0.061 mg CH4 m−2 h−1), and emissions from the downstream river were 0.49 ± 0.20 mg CH4 m−2 h−1. Inflow rivers are hot spots in bubble CH4 emissions that should be examined using field-sampling strategies. This study will improve the accuracy of current and future estimations of CH4 emissions from hydroelectric systems and will help guide mitigation strategies for greenhouse gas emissions.},

abstract = {Extreme weather events can pervasively influence ecosystems. Observations in lakes indicate that severe storms in particular can have pronounced ecosystem-scale consequences, but the underlying mechanisms have not been rigorously assessed in experiments. One major effect of storms on lakes is the redistribution of mineral resources and plankton communities as a result of abrupt thermocline deepening. We aimed at elucidating the importance of this effect by mimicking in replicated large enclosures (each 9 m in diameter, ca. 20 m deep, ca. 1300 m3 in volume) a mixing event caused by a severe natural storm that was previously observed in a deep clear-water lake. Metabolic rates were derived from diel changes in vertical profiles of dissolved oxygen concentrations using a Bayesian modelling approach, based on high-frequency measurements. Experimental thermocline deepening stimulated daily gross primary production (GPP) in surface waters by an average of 63{\%} for {\textgreater}4 weeks even though thermal stratification re-established within 5 days. Ecosystem respiration (ER) was tightly coupled to GPP, exceeding that in control enclosures by 53{\%} over the same period. As GPP responded more strongly than ER, net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of the entire water column was also increased. These protracted increases in ecosystem metabolism and autotrophy were driven by a proliferation of inedible filamentous cyanobacteria released from light and nutrient limitation after they were entrained from below the thermocline into the surface water. Thus, thermocline deepening by a single severe storm can induce prolonged responses of lake ecosystem metabolism independent of other storm-induced effects, such as inputs of terrestrial materials by increased catchment run-off. This highlights that future shifts in frequency, severity or timing of storms are an important component of climate change, whose impacts on lake thermal structure will superimpose upon climate trends to influence algal dynamics and organic matter cycling in clear-water lakes.},

abstract = {Rapid increases in human population and land transformation in arid and semi-arid regions are altering water, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, yet little is known about how urban ephemeral stream channels in these regions affect biogeochemistry and trace gas fluxes. To address these knowledge gaps, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) before and after soil wetting in 16 ephemeral stream channels that vary in soil texture and organic matter in Tucson, AZ. Fluxes of CO2 and N2O immediately following wetting were among the highest ever published (up to 1,588 mg C m−2 h−1 and 3,121 $\mu$g N m−2 h−1). Mean post-wetting CO2 and N2O fluxes were significantly higher in the loam and sandy loam channels (286 and 194 mg C m−2 h−1; 168 and 187 $\mu$g N m−2 h−1) than in the sand channels (45 mg C m−2 h−1 and 7 $\mu$g N m−2 h−1). Factor analyses show that the effect of soil moisture, soil C and soil N on trace gas fluxes varied with soil texture. In the coarser sandy sites, trace gas fluxes were primarily controlled by soil moisture via physical displacement of soil gases and by organic soil C and N limitations on biotic processes. In the finer sandy loam sites trace gas fluxes and N-processing were primarily limited by soil moisture, soil organic C and soil N resources. In the loam sites, finer soil texture and higher soil organic C and N enhance soil moisture retention allowing for more biologically favorable antecedent conditions. Variable redox states appeared to develop in the finer textured soils resulting in wide ranging trace gas flux rates following wetting. These findings indicate that urban ephemeral channels are biogeochemical hotspots that can have a profound impact on urban C and N biogeochemical cycling pathways and subsequently alter the quality of localized water resources.},

abstract = {Sediment accumulation in lakes provides a small but permanent carbon sink. To date, global estimates of the C cycle have barely considered variations in lake carbon burial. To improve the understanding of carbon storage in lakes this study analyzed the sedimentary record of 228 European lakes concerning long-term carbon burial and its correlation to lake and catchment properties. The results suggest that carbon mass accumulations in small lakes are significantly lower than those used for global estimates so far. On the other hand, the total surface area of small lakes has been severely underestimated. Results from calculations based on a Pareto distribution show that total lake surface is 240,000 km2 in Europe. We estimate total C burial in European lakes at 1.25 Mt yr-1. Half this storage takes place in boreal lakes of northern Europe, although they contribute up to 65{\%} to the European lake surface. This is due to generally lower carbon burial rates in this region. Carbon mass accumulation rates increased in many lakes between 5000 to 2000 years BP. This coincides with increased clastic inputs due to land use change, i.e., increasing cropland coverage and soil erosion. On average, carbon accumulation rates are twice as high in younger sediments at 20 cm depth when compared to the long-term mean. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {We used data collected from 1989 to 2009 from 151 shallow (mean depth {\textless} 3 m) temperate lakes in Denmark to explore the influence of lake trophic status, surface area and catchment size on the seasonal dynamics of the air-water flux of CO 2. Monthly CO 2 fluxes were derived from measurements of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), pH, ionic strength, temperature, and wind speed. CO 2 fluxes exhibited large seasonal variability, in particular in oligo-mesotrophic lakes. Most of the lakes emitted CO 2 during winter (median rates ranging 300-1,900 mg C m -2day -1), and less CO 2 during summer or, in the case of some of the highly eutrophic lakes, retained CO 2 during summer. We found that seasonal CO 2 fluxes were strongly negatively correlated with pH (r = -0.65, P {\textless}0.01), which in turn was correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations (r = 0.48, P {\textless}0.01). Our analysis suggests that lake trophic status (a proxy for pelagic production) interacts with the lake ANC to drive the seasonal dynamics of CO 2 fluxes, largely by changing pH and thereby the equilibrium of the free CO 2 and bicarbonate relation. Long-term observations from four lakes, which have all undergone a period of oligotrophication during the past two decades, provide further evidence that CO 2 efflux generally increases as trophic status decreases, as a consequence of decreased pH. Across these four lakes, the annual average CO 2 emission has increased by 32{\%} during the past two decades, thus, demonstrating the strong link between lake trophic status and CO 2 flux. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Whole-lake carbon (C) mass-balance budgets were constructed for a chain of six hard-water lakes to quantify the relative importance of organic carbon (OC) and inorganic carbon (IC) exchanges between atmosphere, water column, sediments, and rivers. Mean summer C fluxes were calculated for each lake during the ice-free periods (May to September) of 1995-2007 by measuring deposition of IC and OC in lake sediments, export of C to outflow rivers, lotic C influxes, and atmospheric exchange of CO2. Unlike soft-water lakes, IC in rivers accounted for 68.2-85.6{\%} of total C (TC) influx to these hard-water lakes, CO2 efflux accounted for 0-44.5{\%} of total C export (median 2.8{\%}), and sedimentation buried similar amounts of OC and IC. Deposition of C in sediments accounted for 1.8-61.7{\%} of total export and was correlated to water residence time, while C efflux through rivers accounted for 32.6-98.2{\%} of total export, mainly as IC (69.6-85.1{\%} of TC). Unexpectedly, estimates of net ecosystem production based on OC mass balances suggested that all lakes were autotrophic (production {\textgreater} respiration) during summer, despite elevated dissolved organic carbon content (5.6-16.1 mg C L-1), pCO2 values, and net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from three lakes. We conclude that C fluxes within and among these hard-water lakes are regulated by hydrologic inputs of dissolved IC rather than by lake metabolism, IC and OC pathways are only loosely coupled, and future climate variability will alter C fluxes in similar lakes mainly through regulation of mass transfer from land. {\textcopyright} 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel tool, ThSSim, for simulation of thermal stratification (ThS) in reservoirs. ThSSim is a simple and flexible reduced-order model-based the basis function (RMBF) that combines CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). In a case study, it was used to simulate water temperature in the Karkheh Reservoir (KR), Iran, for the period 2019–2035. ThSSim consists of two space- and time-dependent components that add predictive ability to the RMBF, a major refinement that extends its practical applications. Water temperature simulations by the W2 model at three-hour time intervals for the KR were used as input data to the POD model to develop ThSSim. To add predictive ability to ThSSim and considering that space-dependent components are not a function of time, we extrapolated the first three time-dependent components by September 30, 2035. We checked the predictive ability of ThSSim against water temperature profiles measured during eight sampling campaigns. We then applied ThSSim to simulate water temperature in the KR for 2019–2035. Simulated water temperature values matched well those measured and obtained by W2. ThSSim results showed an increasing trend for surface water temperature during the simulation period, with a reverse trend observed for water temperature in the bottom layers for three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). The results also indicated decreasing and increasing trends in onset and breakdown of thermal stability, respectively, so that the duration of ThS increased from 278 days in 2019 to 293 days in 2035. ThSSim is thus useful for reservoir temperature simulations. Moreover, the approach used to develop ThSSim is widely applicable to other fields of science and engineering.},

This is the result of increasing demand for water, reduction of water resources, and increasing pollution of water, driven by dramatic population and economic growth. It is suggested that this number may be an underestimation, and scarcity of clean water by 2050 may be worse as the effects of the three drivers of water scarcity, as well as of unequal growth, accessibility and needs, are underrated. While the report promotes the spontaneous adoption of nature-based-solutions within an unconstrained population and economic expansion, there is an urgent need to regulate demography and economy, while enforcing clear rules to limit pollution, preserve aquifers and save water, equally applying everywhere. The aim of this paper is to highlight the inter-linkage in between population and economic growth and water demand, resources and pollution, that ultimately drive water scarcity, and the relevance of these aspects in local, rather than global, perspective, with a view to stimulating debate.},

abstract = {Water-level fluctuations, often linked to seasonal climatic trends, are a natural phenomenon which occur in almost all aquatic ecosystems. In some climatic regions, as the Mediterranean one, they are particularly wide due to the occurrence of two well separated periods: the rainy winter and the almost completely dry summer. Precipitation is concentrated in the first period, whereas in the second strong evaporation losses take place. According to these climatic features, and to ensure a continuous supply of water throughout the year, man-made lakes store water during winter and are subjected to dewatering during summer to compensate the lack of precipitation. These ecosystems are thus characterised by rather wide water level fluctuations which were observed to transform them from potentially warm monomictic lakes into polymictic or atelomictic ones. These changes deeply affect the biological structure and the functions of the water bodies impairing the response of some ecosystem properties, as resilience and resistance, since the impacts are immense enough to move the systems out of their homeostatic plateau of, respectively, deep or shallow lakes. In order to understand to what extent a reservoir can be "emptied" without changing its ecosystemic identity (deep or shallow lake sensu Padis{\'{a}}k {\&} Reynolds, 2003) and to set a "dewatering threshold", the results from two different hydrological years, one with a dewatering so intense as to disrupt thermal stratification in midsummer, and the other one with water enough to allow the maintenance of the reservoir's thermal structure throughout the summer, are compared. Former investigations have shown that the persistence of thermal stratification has a positive value in Sicilian reservoirs: a notable decrease in total phytoplankton biomass and in the relative occurrence of cyanoprokaryotes was observed in the high-level year with a stable thermal stratification. Although the solving of the external load problems causing eutrophication phenomena remain the main task to improve the water quality of this Mediterranean island, a management procedure, based on the maintaining of the ecosystem within its homeostatic plateau through the setting of a dewatering threshold, is suggested. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {The concentration of oxygen is fundamental tolake water quality and ecosystem functioning through itscontrol over habitat availability for organisms, redox reactions, and recycling of organic material. In many eutrophiclakes, oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) occurs annually during summer stratification. The temporal and spatial extent of summer hypolimneticanoxia is determined by interactions between the lake andits external drivers (e.g., catchment characteristics, nutrientloads, meteorology) as well as internal feedback mechanisms (e.g., organic matter recycling, phytoplankton blooms). Howthese drivers interact to control the evolution of lake anoxiaover decadal timescales will determine, in part, the futurelake water quality. In this study, we used a verticalone-dimensional hydrodynamic ecological model (GLMAED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchmentmodel (PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water qualitydynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA) over a37 year period. The calibration and validation of the lakemodel consisted of a global sensitivity evaluation as well asthe application of an optimization algorithm to improve thefit between observed and simulated data. We calculated stabilityindices (Schmidt stability, Birgean work, stored internalheat), identified spring mixing and summer stratificationperiods, and quantified the energy required for stratificationand mixing. To qualify which external and internal factorswere most important in driving the interannual variation insummer anoxia, we applied a random-forest classifier andmultiple linear regressions to modeled ecosystem variables (e.g., stratification onset and offset, ice duration, gross primaryproduction). Lake Mendota exhibited prolonged hypolimneticanoxia each summer, lasting between 50 60 d. The summer heat budget, the timing of thermal stratification, and the gross primary production in the epilimnion prior tosummer stratification were the most important predictors ofthe spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia periods inLake Mendota. Interannual variability in anoxia was largelydriven by physical factors: earlier onset of thermal stratificationin combination with a higher vertical stability stronglyaffected the duration and spatial extent of summer anoxia. A measured step change upward in summer anoxia in 2010was unexplained by the GLM-AED2 model. Although thecause remains unknown, possible factors include invasion bythe predacious zooplankton Bythotrephes longimanus. As theheat budget depended primarily on external meteorologicalconditions, the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxiain Lake Mendota is likely to increase in the near future as a result of projected climate change in the region.},

abstract = {The episodic nature of water availability in arid and semiarid ecosystems has significant consequences on belowground carbon and nutrient cycling. Pulsed water events directly control belowground processes through soil wet-dry cycles. Rapid soil microbial response to incident moisture availability often results in almost instantaneous C and N mineralization, followed by shifts in C/N of microbially available substrate, and an offset in the balance between nutrient immobilization and mineralization. Nitrogen inputs from biological soil crusts are also highly sensitive to pulsed rain events, and nitrogen losses, particularly gaseous losses due to denitrification and nitrate leaching, are tightly linked to pulses of water availability. The magnitude of the effect of water pulses on carbon and nutrient pools, however, depends on the distribution of resource availability and soil organisms, both of which are strongly affected by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of vegetation cover, topographic position and soil texture. The 'inverse texture hypothesis' for net primary production in water-limited ecosystems suggests that coarse-textured soils have higher NPP than fine-textured soils in very arid zones due to reduced evaporative losses, while NPP is greater in fine-textured soils in higher rainfall ecosystems due to increased water-holding capacity. With respect to belowground processes, fine-textured soils tend to have higher water-holding capacity and labile C and N pools than coarse-textured soils, and often show a much greater flush of N mineralization. The result of the interaction of texture and pulsed rainfall events suggests a corollary hypothesis for nutrient turnover in arid and semiarid ecosystems with a linear increase of N mineralization in coarse-textured soils, but a saturating response for fine-textured soils due to the importance of soil C and N pools. Seasonal distribution of water pulses can lead to the accumulation of mineral N in the dry season, decoupling resource supply and microbial and plant demand, and resulting in increased losses via other pathways and reduction in overall soil nutrient pools. The asynchrony of resource availability, particularly nitrogen versus water due to pulsed water events, may be central to understanding the consequences for ecosystem nutrient retention and long-term effects on carbon and nutrient pools. Finally, global change effects due to changes in the nature and size of pulsed water events and increased asynchrony of water availability and growing season will likely have impacts on biogeochemical cycling in water-limited ecosystems. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Aeration with the commercially available LIMNO aerator has now been in use for about 10 years. Over 40 aerator units have been installed and successfully operated in nine different projects. From the abundant experience gathered during this relatively long period some examples are chosen to illustrate the efforts on increased mineralization capacity of allochthonous and autochthonous organic material. The ubiquitous eutrophication problems especially degrade water quality in lakes and reservoirs. Excessively produced algal material in the hypolimnetic layer leads to serious anoxia, preventing higher life and aerobic respiration processes. Furthermore, internal recycling processes connected with the metabolic and geochemical cycles of manganese and iron enable the multiple use of recycled phosphorus. All of these processes are possible to control by aeration. On the other hand, necessary treatment for drinking water preparation, such as filtration, flocculation, and chlorination can be reduced if a sufficient oxygen balance is maintained in the hypolimnetic water body. Results are presented from two drinking water reservoirs and some lakes where drastic improvements were observed. {\textcopyright} 1984 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Our results showed a strong similarity between lakes, rivers, and old reservoirs across a 5000 km transect from the west coast to the east cost of Canada. These values are comparable to those observed in Finland or in the sub-tropical semi-arid western USA.

Better and more accurate methods are needed to quantify CH4 flux from terrestrial environments. Two general methods commonly applied to measure trace gas fluxes are soil cover (chamber) techniques, and micrometeorology methods. Both of these methods has advantages and disadvantages, yet little information is available concerning the relative performance of the techniques. This study was conducted to compare CH4 flux measurements obtained by using a closed-chamber soil cover technique and a micrometeorological method (Bowen-ratio Energy Balance [BREB]). Methane flux rates obtained by both methods were compared using nine time points over 3 d at a peatland site in north central Minnesota. Mean CH4 fluxes obtained by both methods were of the same magnitude (2.43-5.88 mg CH4 m-2 h-1); however, differences were observed in the magnitudes of temporal variability as well as the detection sensitivities (minimum detectable flux). The minimum detectable flux for the closed-chamber method was 9.32×10-2 mg CH4 m-2 h-1, while the minimum detectable flux for the BREB method ranged from 2.16 to 25.5 mg CH4 m-2 h-1. Due to analytical uncertainties associated with gas chromatographic determination of CH4 gradients, the BREB is not recommended.},

We show that climate change–induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase (19 ± 14{\%}) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the “business-as-usual” scenario. The impacts, driven by projected increases in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn belt of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 ± 24{\%} reduction in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive management challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future changes in precipitation on nitrogen loading.},

abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 °C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

abstract = {Lakes are critical natural resources that are sensitive to changes in climate. There are more than 100 million lakes globally 1 , holding 87{\%} of Earth's liquid sur­ face freshwater 2. Lakes support a global heritage of biodiversity 3 and provide key ecosystem services 4 ; as such, they are included in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals committed to water resources (Goal {\#}6) and the impacts of climate change (Goal {\#}13) 5. Lakes are also key indicators of local and regional water­ shed changes, making them useful for detecting Earth's response to climate change 6. Specifically, variables such as lake surface temperature, water level and extent, ice cover and lake colour are recognized by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) because they contribute critically to the characterization of Earth's climate. The scientific value of lake research makes it an essential component of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Lakes are already responding rapidly to climate change. Some of the most pervasive and concerning physical consequences of climate change on lakes are the loss of ice cover 7 , changes in evaporation and water budgets 8,9 , warming surface water temperature 10 and alterations in mixing regimes 11. These lake variables interact with one another (Fig. 1), complicating our ability to predict lake physical responses to climatic variations. For example, changes in ice cover and water temperature modify (and are influenced by) evaporation rates 9 , which can subsequently alter lake levels and surface water extent 12. In the absence of precipitation changes, one of the effects of reduced ice cover, higher surface water temperatures and increased lake evaporation rates could be reductions in lake level and extent. However, land surface runoff and direct precipitation to the lake also affect lake level and extent, which are subject to climatic variations across the lake catchment, reinforcing or even offsetting the effects mediated by evaporation. Such sen­ sitive balances between climatically driven factors lead to spatially variable outcomes for lake-climate inter­ actions that require further elucidation to understand and predict. In this Review, we summarize the responses of key physical lake variables and processes to global climate change, including ice cover, surface water tempera­ ture, evaporation, water levels and mixing regimes, and outline their ecological consequences (Fig. 1). We also identify research needs for improving our global understanding of lake responses to climatic variability and change, including enhancing satellite observa­ tions and in situ technology for monitoring both small lakes (which dominate the global lake distribution) and large lakes with high spatial heterogeneity, developing global­ scale modelling techniques to better predict lake responses under climate change and establishing Global lake responses to climate change Abstract | Climate change is one of the most severe threats to global lake ecosystems. Lake surface conditions, such as ice cover, surface temperature, evaporation and water level, respond dramatically to this threat, as observed in recent decades. In this Review, we discuss physical lake variables and their responses to climate change. Decreases in winter ice cover and increases in lake surface temperature modify lake mixing regimes and accelerate lake evaporation. Where not balanced by increased mean precipitation or inflow, higher evaporation rates will favour a decrease in lake level and surface water extent. Together with increases in extreme-precipitation events, these lake responses will impact lake ecosystems, changing water quantity and quality, food provisioning, recreational opportunities and transportation. Future research opportunities, including enhanced observation of lake variables from space (particularly for small water bodies), improved in situ lake monitoring and the development of advanced modelling techniques to predict lake processes, will improve our global understanding of lake responses to a changing climate. ✉},

abstract = {Wetlands, and especially their littoral zones, are considered to be CH4 emissions hotspots. The recent creation of reservoirs has caused a rapid increase in the area of the world's littoral zones. To investigate the effects of water depth and water level fluctuation on CH4 fluxes, and how these are coupled with vegetation and nutrients, we used static closed chamber and gas chromatography techniques to measure CH4 fluxes in the littoral zone of a large reservoir near Beijing, China, from November 2011 to October 2012. We found that CH4 flux decreased significantly along a transect from open water to dry land, from 3.1 mg m−2 h−1 at the deep water site to approximately 1.3 mg m−2 h−1 at the shallow water site, and less than 0.01 mg m−2 h−1 in the non-flooded area. Water level influenced CH4 flux by affecting soil properties including soil redox potential, soil carbon and nitrogen, and bulk density. The largest emission of all was from the seasonally flooded site after a flooding event (up to 21.1 mg m−2 h−1), which may have been caused by vegetation decomposition. Submerged sites had greater emissions, while the driest site had lower emissions. Immediately after the monthly measurements had been made, we removed the aboveground vegetation to enable an assessment of the gas transportation per unit of biomass. Removal of biomass decreased emissions by up to 53{\%}. These results indicated the dominant effect of water depth on CH4 flux through effects of soil conditions, plant species composition and distribution. This study suggests that temporally flooded wetlands, including littoral zones, contribute significantly to the global CH4 burden. However, the current challenge is to capture their spatial extent and temporal variation in the fluxes.},

abstract = {Surface water-methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations were measured and diffusive fluxes were estimated in three subtropical freshwater reservoirs (Little Nerang Dam (LND), Lake Wivenhoe (LW) and Lake Baroon (LB)) in southeast Queensland, Australia, during four seasons in 2011-2012. All reservoirs were strong sources of CH4 in all seasons. Surface water CH4 varied between 1350 and 524 000{\%} saturation, and was overall highest in spring and summer, and lowest in winter, however, with no clear patterns common to all reservoirs. In contrast, all reservoirs switched from weak N2O sinks in spring to strong N2O sources for the rest of the year. N2O saturation in all reservoirs varied between 70 and 1230{\%}. There were significant differences for CH4 concentrations and fluxes between the reservoirs. Within each reservoir, there was strong spatial CH4 variability but minimal N2O saturation variability. CH4 saturation was higher in inflow zones than in the main body. Area-weighted average fluxes were estimated using six water-air gas transfer velocity estimation models and resulted in fluxes in the range 4.8-20.5, 2.3-5.4, and 2.3-7.5 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, while N2O was 0.07-0.41, 0.09-0.22, and 0.03-0.09 mg N2O m-2 d-1 for LND, LW, and LB, respectively. Total emissions, in carbon dioxide equivalents, from all measurement campaigns were CH4 dominated (67-86{\%}). The measured degree of CH4 saturation and fluxes are among the highest reported thus far indicating that subtropical freshwater reservoirs could be significant aquatic greenhouse gas sources. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the interplay between biogeochemical processes and the physical forcing driving the water-air gaseous emissions. The high variability coupled with the lack of consensus among estimation models calls for concerted efforts to address uncertainty of measurements for reliable emissions accounting.},

A down-scaling technique is used which involves the matching of daily circulation output from the model for a sequence of years in the late twentieth century (1971-90) and for a corresponding period in the late twenty first century (2080-99) to derive probable regional atmospheric pattern (AP) frequencies for this latter period, and thence to estimate likely changes in annual precipitation. Model days are classified by searching for the closest analogue amongst 19 previously identified APs from an earlier study. Future annual precipitation distribution is derived using previously established relationships between circulation type and daily precipitation distribution. Predicted AP frequencies and precipitation amounts and distribution are compensated by comparing model output with ECMWF data for a decade (1984-93) within the 1971-90 sequence, so that the analysis also provides a verification of the performance of the model. In general the agreement between model output and actual AP frequencies is very good for the present day, though for this southerly region the model appears slightly to under-estimate the frequency of easterly type circulations, many of which yield some of the most significant autumn severe storm rainfalls along the Mediterranean coast. The model tends to over-estimate the frequency of westerly type situations. The study utilises a 'moving window' technique in an attempt to derive measures of inter-decadal variability within the two 20 year periods. This avoids use of data from outside the periods, which would incorporate changing AP frequencies during a period of sustained climate change. Quite pronounced changes in frequency are indicated for certain APs. Marked decreases in frequency are indicated for many near-surface circulations with a westerly or northerly component. For APs with an easterly component, some are shown to increase, others to decrease. Increases in inter-decadal variability are strongly indicated for most APs, though for some easterly situations there is no clear signal. A significant annual precipitation reduction of between 6 to 14{\%} is indicated for Andaluc{\'{i}}ua and the upland parts of Catalu{\~{n}}a. In contrast, there is an increase in annual totals of up to 14{\%} along parts of the coast between Almer{\'{i}}a and the French border.},

abstract = {Human population growth, economic development, climate change, and the need to close the electricity access gap have stimulated the search for new sources of renewable energy. In response to this need, major new initiatives in hydropower development are now under way. At least 3,700 major dams, each with a capacity of more than 1 MW, are either planned or under construction, primarily in countries with emerging economies. These dams are predicted to increase the present global hydroelectricity capacity by 73 {\%} to about 1,700 GW. Even such a dramatic expansion in hydropower capacity will be insufficient to compensate for the increasing electricity demand. Furthermore, it will only partially close the electricity gap, may not substantially reduce greenhouse gas emission (carbon dioxide and methane), and may not erase interdependencies and social conflicts. At the same time, it is certain to reduce the number of our planet's remaining free-flowing large rivers by about 21 {\%}. Clearly, there is an urgent need to evaluate and to mitigate the social, economic, and ecological ramifications of the current boom in global dam construction.},

abstract = {There is growing concern in Europe about the possible rise in the severity and frequency of extreme drought events as a manifestation of climate change. In order to plan suitable adaptation strategies it is important for decision makers to know how drought conditions will develop at regional scales. This paper therefore addresses the issue of future developments in streamflow drought characteristics across Europe. Through offline coupling of a hydrological model with an ensemble of bias-corrected climate simulations (IPCC SRES A1B) and a water use scenario (Economy First), long-term (1961-2100) ensemble streamflow simulations are generated that account for changes in climate, and the uncertainty therein, and in water consumption. Using extreme value analysis we derive minimum flow and deficit indices and evaluate how the magnitude and severity of low-flow conditions may evolve throughout the 21st century. This analysis shows that streamflow droughts will become more severe and persistent in many parts of Europe due to climate change, except for northern and northeastern parts of Europe. In particular, southern regions will face strong reductions in low flows. Future water use will aggravate the situation by 10-30{\%} in southern Europe, whereas in some sub-regions in western, central and eastern Europe a climate-driven signal of reduced droughts may be reversed due to intensive water use. The multi-model ensemble projections of more frequent and severe streamflow droughts in the south and decreasing drought hazard in the north are highly significant, while the projected changes are more dissonant in a transition zone in between. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s) .},

abstract = {The patterns of spatial and temporal variability in CO2 and CH4 emission from reservoirs are still poorly studied, especially in tropical regions where hydropower is growing. We performed spatially resolved measurements of dissolved CO2 and CH4 surface water concentrations and their gas-exchange coefficients (k) to compute diffusive carbon flux from four contrasting tropical reservoirs across Brazil during different hydrological seasons. We used an online equilibration system to measure dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations; we estimated k from floating chamber deployments in conjunction with discrete CO2 and CH4 water concentration measurements. Diffusive CO2 emissions were higher during dry season than during rainy season, whereas there were no consistent seasonal patterns for diffusive CH4 emissions. Our results reveal that the magnitude and the spatial within-reservoir patterns of diffusive CO2 and CH4 flux varied strongly among hydrological seasons. River inflow areas were often characterized by high seasonality in diffusive flux. Areas close to the dam generally showed low seasonal variability in diffusive CH4 flux but high variability in CO2 flux. Overall, we found that reservoir areas exhibiting highest emission rates (“hotspots”) shifted substantially across hydrological seasons. Estimates of total diffusive carbon emission from the reservoir surfaces differed between hydrological seasons by a factor up to 7 in Chap{\'{e}}u D'{\'{U}}vas, up to 13 in Curu{\'{a}}-Una, up to 4 in Furnas, and up to 1.8 in Funil, indicating that spatially resolved measurements of CO2 and CH4 concentrations and k need to be performed at different hydrological seasons in order to constrain annual diffusive carbon emission.},

However, sparse long-term monitoring of lake ecosystems has prevented reconstruction of global hypoxia dynamics while inhibiting investigations into its causes and assessing the resilience capacity of these systems. This study compiles the onset and duration of hypoxia recorded in sediments of 365 lakes worldwide since AD 1700, showing that lacustrine hypoxia started spreading before AD 1900, 70 years prior to hypoxia in coastal zones. This study also shows that the increase of human activities and nutrient release is leading to hypoxia onset. No correlations were found with changes in precipitation or temperature. There is no evidence for a post-1980s return to well-oxygenated lacustrine conditions in industrialized countries despite the implementation of restoration programs. The apparent establishment of stable hypoxic conditions prior to AD 1900 highlights the challenges of a growing nutrient demand, accompanied by increasing global nutrient emissions of our industrialized societies, and climate change.},

However, oxygen dynamics in waterbodies are changing globally due to land use and climate, and the consequences of variable oxygen conditions for OC burial are unknown. We manipulated hypolimnetic oxygen availability in a whole-reservoir experiment and used a mass balance OC model to quantify rates of OC burial. Throughout summer stratification, we observed that OC burial rates were tightly coupled to sediment oxygen concentrations: oxic conditions pro- moted the mineralization of “legacy” OC that had accumulated over years of sedimentation, resulting in neg- ative OC burial. Moreover, our study demonstrates that fluctuating oxygen conditions can switch ecosystem- scale OC burial in a reservoir between positive and negative rates. Consequently, changing oxygen availabil- ity in freshwaters globally will likely have large implications for the role of these ecosystems as OC sinks.},

abstract = {The oxidative degradation of organic matter is a key process in the biogeochemical functioning of the earth system. Quantitative models of organic matter degradation are therefore essential for understanding the chemical state and evolution of the Earth's near-surface environment, and to forecast the biogeochemical consequences of ongoing regional and global change. The complex nature of biologically produced organic matter represents a major obstacle to the development of such models, however. Here, we compare the energetics of the oxidative degradation of a large number of naturally occurring organic compounds. By relating the Gibbs energies of half reactions describing the complete mineralization of the compounds to their average nominal carbon oxidation state, it becomes possible to estimate the energetic potential of the compounds based on major element (C, H, N, O, P, S) ratios. The new energetic description of organic matter can be combined with bioenergetic theory to rationalize observed patterns in the decomposition of natural organic matter. For example, the persistence of cell membrane derived compounds and complex organics in anoxic settings is consistent with their limited catabolic potential under these environmental conditions. The proposed approach opens the way to include the thermodynamic properties of organic compounds in kinetic models of organic matter degradation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Aracena and La Minilla reservoirs were studied since July 1973 and El Gergal reservoir since October 1979. The results allowed the examination of the different factors which control thc interannual variability of the trophic state of the reservoirs. Because of the high variability of average yearly rainfall, that is characteristic of the Mediterranean climate asea, the water renewal rate of the reservoirs varies greatly from year to year. This water renewal rate plays a more important role than nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) availability in controlling algal biomass and consequently, primary production. Nevertheless, its relative importance depends on the phosphorus loading of each reservoir. In the case of La Minilla reservoir, water renewal rate is the only factor significantly correlated with phytoplankton biomass.},

abstract = {Summertime hypolimnetic anoxia can occur in productive drinking water reservoirs as a result of the decay of phytoplankton. Anoxic conditions promote ecological processes that degrade water quality through the release of problem-causing compounds from anoxic sediments including phosphates, ammonia, sulfides, methyl-mercury, iron and manganese. Hypolimnetic aeration systems are commonly installed in reservoirs to prevent hypolimnetic anoxia, but these systems have been historically undersized due to an underestimation of the magnitude of oxygen demand in the hypolimnion. To gain insight into the sizing of hypolimnetic aeration systems, this study evaluated the effects of water current and DO concentration near the sediment-water interface on sediment oxygen demand (SOD) in nine California drinking water reservoirs of various size (5–220 million m3) and trophic status (mean annual chlorophyll a of 0.5–11 $\mu$g L−1). SOD measured under quiescent conditions in 1.8 L experimental chambers ranged from 0.1–0.8 g m2 d1 Currents near the sediment-water interface of 3–8 cm s1 induced a two to four-fold increase in SOD, and resulted in a shift from first-order to zero-order DO uptake by sediment with respect to DO concentration in overlaying water. Results support the diffusive boundary layer model for SOD, with increased DO concentration and currents resulting in a larger SOD since there is a greater diffusional driving force across a smaller diffusive boundary layer. The study also evaluated the effects of trophic status and morphometry on hypolimnetic anoxia at the nine study sites. A number of significant correlations were discovered between factor quantifying hypolimnetic anoxia (areal and mass based hypolimnetic oxygen demand, SOD) and those quantifying morphometry (mean depth of the hypolimnion, volume of the hypolimnion) and trophic status (mean annual chlorophyll a). These results suggest that both increased size of the hypolimnion and higher productivity lead to higher oxygen demand within the hypolimnion. In addition, shallower reservoirs had a larger fraction of their total oxygen demand exerted in the sediments versus the water column. As a result, increased mixing at the sediment-water interface after start-up of aeration systems, and the resulting stimulation of SOD, will be particularly important in productive reservoirs of moderate depth (mean depth of 10–15 m). Aeration systems should be designed to enhance SOD by maintaining high oxygen concentrations and by inducing currents at the sediment-water interface. This will increase the depth of penetration of DO into sediment and promote beneficial aerobic biogeochemical reactions in surface sediments. Aeration systems that utilize pure-oxygen with horizontal discharge of highly oxygenated water across the sediment surface, rather than the traditional air-lift aeration system, will be more successful in satisfying SOD and improving hypolimnetic water quality. {\textcopyright} 2003 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Concentrations of dissolved methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured in the water columns of non-oxygenated and artificially oxygenated, ice-covered eutrophied lakes in the mid-boreal zone in Finland during late winter 1997 and 1999. Sampling was conducted during winter stratification, the critical period for oxygen (O2) deficiency in seasonally ice-covered, thermally stratified lakes. Oxygen concentrations were maintained at least at a moderate level throughout the oxygenated water columns, whereas the non-oxygenated columns suffered anoxic hypolimnia. The mean concentrations of dissolved CH4 exceeding the atmospheric equilibrium were greater in the non-oxygenated water columns (20.6-154 microM) than in the oxygenated ones (0.01-1.41 microM). In contrast, the mean excess CO2 concentrations varied less between the non-oxygenated and oxygenated sites (0.28-0.47 and 0.25-0.31 mM, respectively). Oxygenated water columns had greater mean excess concentrations of N2O (0.018-0.032 microM) than the non-oxygenated ones (0.005-0.024 microM). If the accumulated greenhouse gas stores in the water columns during winter are assumed to be released to the atmosphere during the spring overturn, the global warming potentials (GWP, time horizon 100 yr) of these potential emissions at the non-oxygenated, eutrophic study sites ranged from 177 to 654 g CO2 equivalent (CO2-e) m-2 compared with 144 to 173 g CO2-e m-2 at the oxygenated sites. The increase in the accumulation of CH4 was the main reason for the higher GWP of the non-oxygenated sites. Anthropogenic eutrophication of lake ecosystems can generate increased CH4 emissions due to associated O2 depletion of their sediment and water column.},

abstract = {Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion has been recognized as a problem in the central basin of Lake Erie since the 1970s. However, recent expansion in distribution of the depletion after several years of low depletion rates in the 1990s has led investigators to explore the factors that influence the extent of the depletion. We have investigated the vertical oxygen budget in the central basin, which is influenced by the following factors: 1) vertical mixing; 2) exchange across the air-water interface; 3) photosynthesis; 4) respiration of plankton; and 5) sediment oxygen demand. We tested the importance of these factors using a 1-D vertical oxygen budget and transport simulations through sensitivity analysis and by estimating vertical mixing parameters using a temperature gradient microprofiler. Epilimnetic factors were found to be robust and the present monitoring efforts are sufficient; while epilimnetic production is ultimately the source of the hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, epilimnetic factors do not directly influence on hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. However, hypolimnetic depletion was sensitive to sediment oxygen demand and hypolimnion respiration, which are the results of primary production in the epilimnion, and hypolimnetic mixing, which is not related to eutrophication. These parameters, especially the physical mixing measurements, and their links with eutrophication and primary production require greater monitoring and analysis because of their influence on the expansion of oxygen depletion in the central basin of Lake Erie.},

abstract = {Low dissolved oxygen concentration in bottom layers of lakes and reservoirs usually indicates low water quality. In lakes, empirical models predicting anoxia are almost entirely based on the decay of plankton biomass, while in reservoirs recent findings suggest a prominent role of streamflow and load of organic carbon. This suggests a potential link between water quality in reservoirs and climate processes affecting streamflow. Here we support this hypothesis presenting evidence that both interannual climate variability and recent climate change, mainly consisting in a significant increase in potential evapotranspiration in the upstream basin, affected the oxygen content in a Mediterranean reservoir (Sau Reservoir, Spain). Using a 44-year monthly record, we found strong and consistent signatures of El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation in the inflow and reservoir oxygen content. Spectral and wavelet techniques showed that the El Ni{\~{n}}o, streamflow, and reservoir oxygen content series oscillated in common periods, which coincided with the main El Ni{\~{n}}o variability modes. An empirical model explaining the annual oxygen content in the reservoir suggested that a decreasing streamflow trend reduced the oxygen content of the reservoir by about 20{\%}, counteracting remediation measures implemented at the basin upstream the reservoir. Our results provide the first quantitative evidence of climate change effects on reservoir water quality using long-term instrumental data, and indicate that streamflow should be considered as a key variable in assessing climate change impact on reservoir water quality. These results are especially relevant in regions of the world where reservoirs are abundant and most climate models predict a decrease in runoff during the next decades. Both the expected trends and the sensitivity of reservoir water quality to global interannual climate variability should be considered for a correct management of water resources in the present and to design adaptation policies in the future. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {It is well recognized that dam construction aggravates eutrophication and hypoxia in river reservoirs, but the interaction between oxygen dynamics and carbon cycling is often unclear. Here we investigated the external and internal controls on oxygen consumption and effects of hypoxia on carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in a subtropical reservoir in southeast China based on detailed field measurements during 2017 and 2018. Hypoxia lasted 4 months starting in mid-July and expanded from the bottom to near surface water. Rainstorm hyperpycnal flow and unusual hydraulics (outflow exit 40 m from the bottom) resulted in two thermoclines and enhanced the oxygen deficit in deeper water. Microbial respiration accounted for 67.4{\%}–96.5{\%} of total oxygen consumption in the bottom water. The increased supply of organic matter from storm runoff and to a lesser extent primary production in summer enhanced subsequent oxygen consumption. We observed an imbalance between excess CO2 production and oxygen depletion in summer and winter which was likely associated with other processes in the hypolimnion (e.g., chemoautotrophy, anaerobic degradation of organic matter, proton buffering, and nitrification). The water-air CO2 fluxes suggest that the surface reservoir usually served as a CO2 source, but was a sink in summer due to high primary productivity. CO2 was always oversaturated in the hypolimnion; this layer was at the depth of the dam outflow and ultimately released 68{\%} of annual CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. This research confirmed that construction of a hydropower dam has substantially altered reservoir metabolism and regulated the CO2 emission pathway.},

abstract = {Theory predicts, and some evidence demonstrates that in lakes, the depth of the thermo cline can have a large structural influence on the spatial distribution, and strongly influences the composition of plankton communities. However, experimental assessments of responses of the planktonic food web to thermo cline depth have not yet been done at the whole-basin scale. We conducted an experiment wherein we artificially lowered the thermo cline in an isolated basin of a three-basin lake, maintaining another isolated basin as a control. The vertical distribution and taxonomic composition of both phytoplankton and zooplankton were monitored throughout the summer months. Greater phytoplankton production, especially in the epilimnion, attributable mainly to increases in the chlorophytes was observed with thermocline deepening, but at the deepest thermoclines, production was limited. Total zooplankton biomass was unaffected by thermocline depth, suggesting top-down control by predators. Zooplankton biomass peaks were less pronounced in the manipulated basin, but tended to follow the thermocline whether at its normal position or as it was deepened. Zooplankton composition was significantly altered by large increases in densities of predatory cyclopoid copepods and rotifers; taxa commonly found in turbulent environments. Overall, both phytoplankton and zooplankton communities demonstrated important shifts in structure and composition in response to thermocline deepening.},

abstract = {The fluxes of CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere, and the relative contributions of ebullition and molecular diffusion, were determined for a small hypertrophic freshwater lake (Priest Pot, U.K.) over the period May to October 1997. The average total flux of CH4 and CO2 (estimated from 7 sites on the lake) was approximately 52 mmol m-2 d-1 and was apportioned 12 and 40 mmol m-2 d-1 to CH4 and CO2 respectively. Diffusion across the air-water interface accounted for the loss of 0.4 and 40 mmol m-2 d-1 of CH4 and CO2 respectively whilst the corresponding figures for ebullition losses were 12.0 (CH4) and 0.23 (CO2) mmol m-2 d-1. Most CH4 (96{\%}) was lost by ebullition, and most CO2 (99{\%}) by diffusive processes. The ebullition of gas, measured at weekly intervals along a transect of the lake, showed high spatial and temporal variation. The CH4 content of the trapped gas varied between 44 and 88{\%} (by volume) and was highest at the deepest points. Pulses of gas ebullition were detected during periods of rapidly falling barometric pressure. The relevance of the measurements to global estimates of carbon emission from freshwaters are discussed.},

abstract = {The distribution and activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the water column of the alpine meromictic Gek-Gel lake were studied. Apart from traditional microbiological methods based on cultivation and on measuring the process rates with radioactive labels, in situ fluorescent hybridization (FISH) was used, which enables identification and quantification without cultivating organisms. The peak rate of sulfate reduction, 0.486 $\mu$g S l-1 day-1, was found in the chemocline at 33 m. The peak SRB number of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml, as determined by the most probable number method on selective media, was found at the same depth. The phylogenetic affiliation of the SRB, as determined by FISH, revealed the predominance of the Desulfovibrio spp., Desulfobulbus spp., and Desulfoarculus spp./Desulfomonile spp. groups. The numbers of spore-forming Desulfotomaculum spp. increased with depth. The low measured rates of sulfate reduction accompanied by high SRB numbers and the predominance of the groups capable of reducing a wide range of substrates permit us to assume utilization of electron acceptors other than sulfate as the main activity of the SRB in the water column. {\textcopyright} Pleiades Publishing, Inc., 2006.},

@article{Fenner2011,
abstract = {Peatlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, amounting to approximately 455 Pg. Carbon builds up in these water-saturated environments owing to the presence of phenolic compounds-which inhibit microbial activity and therefore prevent the breakdown of organic matter. Anoxic conditions limit the activity of phenol oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of phenolic compounds. Droughts introduce oxygen into these systems, and the frequency of these events is rising. Here, we combine in vitro manipulations, mesocosm experiments and field observations to examine the impact of drought on peatland carbon loss. We show that drought stimulates bacterial growth and phenol oxidase activity, resulting in a reduction in the concentration of phenolic compounds in peat. This further stimulates microbial growth, causing the breakdown of organic matter and the release of carbon dioxide in a biogeochemical cascade. We further show that re-wetting the peat accelerates carbon losses to the atmosphere and receiving waters, owing to drought-induced increases in nutrient and labile carbon levels, which raise pH and stimulate anaerobic decomposition. We suggest that severe drought, and subsequent re-wetting, could destabilize peatland carbon stocks; understanding this process could aid understanding of interactions between peatlands and other environmental trends, and lead to the development of strategies for increasing carbon stocks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Vachon2019,
abstract = {Methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, is produced in and emitted from lakes at globally significant rates. The drivers controlling the proportion of produced CH4 that will reach the atmosphere, however, are still not well understood. We sampled a small eutrophic lake (Soppensee, Switzerland) in 2016–2017 for CH4 concentrations profiles and emissions, combined with water column hydrodynamics to investigate the fate of CH4 produced in hypolimnetic sediments. Using a mass balance approach for the periods between April and October of both years, net CH4 production rates in hypolimnetic sediments ranged between 11.4 and 17.7 mmol m−2 d−1, of which 66–88{\%} was stored in the hypolimnion, 13–27{\%} was diffused to the epilimnion, and 6–7{\%} left the sediments via ebullition. Combining these results with a process-based model we show that water column turbulent diffusivity (Kz) had a major influence on the fate of produced CH4 in the sediments, where higher Kz values potentially lead to greater proportion being oxidized and lower Kz lead to a greater proportion being stored. During fall when the water column mixes, we found that a greater proportion of stored CH4 is emitted if the lake mixes rapidly, whereas a greater proportion will be oxidized if the water column mixes more gradually. This work highlights the central role of lake hydrodynamics in regulating CH4 dynamics and further suggests the potential for CH4 production and emissions to be sensitive to climate-driven alterations in lake mixing regimes and stratification.},

@article{Teodoru2011,
abstract = {We assessed the spatial variability in both, surface carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and in pelagic respiration rates in a newly created 600-km2 boreal reservoir, located in Northern Quebec. We show that total CO2 emission to the atmosphere was highest in the first year after flooding, and that surface fluxes were spatially heterogeneous. This spatial heterogeneity was not random, but was linked to the pre-flood landscapes: reservoir areas overlying former peatbogs and mature forests had the highest average emissions, whereas areas overlying former non-forest and burned soils had the lowest emissions. Total reservoir emissions appeared to decline exponentially in the next 2 years, and so did the degree of spatial heterogeneity in surface fluxes, suggesting a progressive weakening of the link to the pre-flood landscapes, and a homogenization of reservoir processes. We show that pelagic respiration rates were also initially high and spatially heterogeneous, the latter linked to the pre-flood landscapes. A simple, first-order mass balance for the first 3 years after flooding was used to derive potential benthic CO2 production rates, and thus to apportion the total reservoir emissions between its pelagic and benthic components. Extrapolation of the observed declines (normal exponential) in total emission, as well as of the underlying pelagic and benthic fluxes, results in a large underestimation of the fluxes for the fourth year, relative to the measured emissions. We postulate that the initial exponential decline in total emissions is driven primarily by the patterns of decomposition of surface plant biomass, whereas at later stages emission is increasingly dominated by sediment and pelagic respiration, which decline in time at a slower rate. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Reservoirs have been constructed as clean energy sources in recent decades with various environmental impacts. Karst rivers typically exhibit high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations, whether and how reservoirs affect carbon cycling, especially organic carbon (OC)-related biogeochemical processes in karst rivers, are unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, multiple tracer methods (including fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM), ultraviolet (UV) absorption, and stable carbon ($\delta$13C) and radiocarbon ($\Delta$14C) isotopes) were utilized to track composition and property changes of both particulate OC (POC) and dissolved OC (DOC) along river-transition-reservoir transects in the Southwest China karst area. The changes in chemical properties indicated that from the river to the reservoir, terrestrial POC is largely replaced by phytoplankton-derived OC, while gradual coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) removal and addition of phytoplankton-derived OC to the DOC pool occurred as water flowed to the reservoir. Higher primary production in the transition area than that in the reservoir area was observed, which may be caused by nutrient released from suspended particles. Within the reservoir, the production surpassed degradation in the upper 5 m, resulting in a net DIC transformation into DOC and POC and terrestrial DOM degradation. The primary production was then gradually weakened and microbial degradation became more important down the profile. It is estimated that {\~{}}3.1–6.3 mg L−1 ({\~{}}15.5–31.5 mg-C m−2 ({\~{}}10–21{\%})) DIC was integrated into the OC pool through the biological carbon pump (BCP) process in the upper 5 m in the transition and reservoir areas. Our results emphasize the reservoir impact on riverine OC transport, and due to their characteristics, karst areas exhibit a higher BCP potential which is sensitive to human activities (more nutrient are provided) than non-karst areas.},

abstract = {Peatlands in Zoige Plateau contains more than half of peatland carbon stock in China. This part of carbon is losing with climate change through dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, both of which are vulnerable to the environmental changes, especially on the Zoige Plateau with a pace of twice the observed rate of global climate warming. This research aimed to understand how climate change including soil warming, rainfall reduction and water table change affect CO2emissions and whether the trends of changes in CO2emission are consistent with those of pore water DOC concentration. A mesocosm experiment was designed to investigate the CO2emission and pore water DOC during the growing seasons of 2009–2010 under scenarios of passive soil warming, 20{\%} rainfall reduction and changes to the water table levels. The results showed a positive relationship between CO2emission and DOC concentration. For single factor effect, we found no significant relationship between water table and CO2emission or DOC concentration. However, temperature at 5 cm depth was found to have positive linear relationship with CO2emission and DOC concentration. The combined effect of soil warming and rainfall reduction increased CO2emission by 96.8{\%}. It suggested that the drying and warming could stimulate potential emission of CO2. Extending this result to the entire peatland area in Zoige Plateau translates into 0.45 Tg CO2emission per year over a growing season. These results suggested that the dryer and warmer Zoige Plateau will increase CO2emission. We also found the contribution rate of DOC concentration to CO2emission was increased by 12.1{\%} in the surface layer and decreased by 13.8{\%} in the subsurface layer with combined treatment of soil warming and rainfall reduction, which indicated that the warmer and dryer environmental conditions stimulate surface peat decomposition process.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) transfer from inland waters to the atmosphere, known as CO2 evasion, is a component of the global carbon cycle. Global estimates of CO2 evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32Pg Cyr-1 from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg Cyr-1 is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Dissimilatory Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction has an important influence on the geochemistry of modern environments, and Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms, most notably those in the Geobacteraceae family, can play an important role in the bioremediation of subsurface environments contaminated with organic or metal contaminants. Microorganisms with the capacity to conserve energy from Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction are phylogenetically dispersed throughout the Bacteria and Archaea. The ability to oxidize hydrogen with the reduction of Fe(III) is a highly conserved characteristic of hyperthermophilic microorganisms and one Fe(III)-reducing Archaea grows at the highest temperature yet recorded for any organism. Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-reducing microorganisms have the ability to oxidize a wide variety of organic compounds, often completely to carbon dioxide. Typical alternative electron acceptors for Fe(III) reducers include oxygen, nitrate, U(VI) and electrodes. Unlike other commonly considered electron acceptors, Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides, the most prevalent form of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) in most environments, are insoluble. Thus, Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-reducing microorganisms face the dilemma of how to transfer electrons derived from central metabolism onto an insoluble, extracellular electron acceptor. Although microbiological and geochemical evidence suggests that Fe(III) reduction may have been the first form of microbial respiration, the capacity for Fe(III) reduction appears to have evolved several times as phylogenetically distinct Fe(III) reducers have different mechanisms for Fe(III) reduction. Geobacter species, which are representative of the family of Fe(III) reducers that predominate in a wide diversity of sedimentary environments, require direct contact with Fe(III) oxides in order to reduce them. In contrast, Shewanella and Geothrix species produce chelators that solubilize Fe(III) and release electron-shuttling compounds that transfer electrons from the cell surface to the surface of Fe(III) oxides not in direct contact with the cells. Electron transfer from the inner membrane to the outer membrane in Geobacter and Shewanella species appears to involve an electron transport chain of inner-membrane, periplasmic, and outer-membrane c-type cytochromes, but the cytochromes involved in these processes in the two organisms are different. In addition, Geobacter species specifically express flagella and pili during growth on Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides and are chemotactic to Fe(II) and Mn(II), which may lead Geobacter species to the oxides under anoxic conditions. The physiological characteristics of Geobacter species appear to explain why they have consistently been found to be the predominant Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-reducing microorganisms in a variety of sedimentary environments. In comparison with other respiratory processes, the study of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction is in its infancy, but genome-enabled approaches are rapidly advancing our understanding of this environmentally significant physiology.},

abstract = {Three diel field campaigns and one monthly sampling campaign during June 2010-May 2011 were carried out to investigate the CH 4 flux across the water-gas interface in Xiangxi Bay of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. The average CH 4 flux was much less than that reported from reservoirs in tropic and temperate regions. The photosynthesis of phytoplankton dominated the diel gas fluxes during alga bloom in spring and summer. The maximum monthly flux occurred in June 2010 and corresponded to the lowest water level. Water temperature, sediment temperature, and TOC did not have significant correlation with the monthly CH 4 fluxes. Continuously decreasing hydrostatic pressure and the low water level resulted in more CH 4 emission at the sediment-water during the discharging period, and thus increases the CH 4 effluxes because the diffusion time through a thin water column is shorter and less CH 4 may be oxidized compared with that in a long water column.},

abstract = {Large continental reservoirs are important sinks of terrestrially-derived carbon (C), yet exhibit high inter-annual variability in net CO2 exchange with the atmosphere due to incompletely understood interactions between supply of solutes (C, nutrients, pH) and lake metabolism. Here we quantified the interaction between hydrology, aquatic metabolism and atmospheric CO2 exchange in the lacustrine Qu'Appelle arm of Lake Diefenbaker, Canada, by comparing total phytoplankton abundance (as Chlorophyll a), net primary productivity (NPP), ratios of microbial productivity (P) to respiration (R), and chemically-enhanced CO2 flux over four springs and summers (2010-2013) with contrasting hydrologic characteristics. Overall, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were correlated inversely (R2adj = 0.63, p {\textless} 0.0001) with $\delta$18O values of DO indicating a strong metabolic coupling in this polymictic basin, whereas correlations between concentration and C isotope ratios of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were not significant (R2adj {\textless} 0.05). In most years, P:R modeled from DO characteristics was {\textgreater}1, the basin was slightly autotrophic and CO2 was captured from the atmosphere. In contrast, the Qu'Appelle arm was a substantial source of CO2 during 2012 when river discharge was low, pH was {\textless}8.6, cyanobacteria were common, and P:R was {\textless}1. Multiple least-squares regressions and principal component analysis inferred that hydrologic variability influenced changes in water-column metabolism, whereas independent variation in pH was the main control of atmospheric CO2 exchange (R2adj CO2-pH = 0.84, p {\textless} 0.0001). Together, these findings suggest that lacustrine basins of alkaline reservoirs may lack strong coupling of water-column metabolism and CO2 dynamics on seasonal and inter-annual scales.},

abstract = {Model-based estimates suggest that lake sediments may be a significant, long-term sink for organic carbon (C) at regional to global scales. These models have used various approaches to predict sediment storage at broad scales from very limited data sets. Here, we report a large-scale direct assessment of the standing stock and sedimentation rate of C for a representative set of lakes in Finland. The 122 lakes were selected from the statistically selected Nordic Lake Survey database, they cover the entire country and the water quality represents the average lake water quality in Finland. Unlike all prior estimates, these data use sediment cores that comprise the entire sediment record. The data show that within Finland, aquatic ecosystems contain the second largest areal C stocks (19 kg Cm-2 ) after peatlands (72 kg Cm-2 ), and exceed by significant amounts stocks in the forest soil (uppermost 75 cm; 7.2 kg Cm-2 ) and woody biomass (3.4 kg Cm -2).

abstract = {Methane is a potent greenhouse gas whose emission from sediments in inland waters and shallow oceans may both contribute to global warming and be exacerbated by it. The fraction of methane emitted by sediments that bypasses dissolution in the water column and reaches the atmosphere as bubbles depends on the mode and spatiotemporal characteristics of venting from the sediments. Earlier studies have concluded that hot spots - persistent, high-flux vents - dominate the regional ebullitive flux from submerged sediments. Here the spatial structure, persistence, and variability in the intensity of methane venting are analyzed using a high-resolution multibeam sonar record acquired at the bottom of a lake during multiple deployments over a 9 month period. We confirm that ebullition is strongly episodic, with distinct regimes of high flux and low flux largely controlled by changes in hydrostatic pressure. Our analysis shows that the spatial pattern of ebullition becomes homogeneous at the sonar's resolution over time scales of hours (for high-flux periods) or days (for low-flux periods), demonstrating that vents are ephemeral rather than persistent, and suggesting that long-term, lake-wide ebullition dynamics may be modeled without resolving the fine-scale spatial structure of venting.},

abstract = {Microorganisms play pivotal roles within aquatic ecosystems, affecting their structure, functioning and services. However, little is known about the effects of water stratification and mixing on the aquatic microbial community dynamics in subtropical reservoirs. In this study, we explored vertical and seasonal patterns of microbial diversity in the Dongzhen Reservoir (southeast China). Quantitative PCR, quantitative RT-PCR, and 454 pyrosequencing were used for an in-depth characterization of the bacterial community across time (every three months for one year) and space (five different water depths). Our results indicated that thermal and oxygen stratification shaped the phylogenetic composition of microbial communities in the reservoir. There were significant differences in physical, chemical and microbiological parameters between epilimnion and hypolimnion (P {\textless} 0.05). The RNA: DNA ratios were significantly lower in epilimnion and metalimnion but rapidly increased in hypolimnion (P {\textless} 0.05), suggesting that microorganisms were more active at low temperatures, low dissolved oxygen concentrations and high TN/TP ratios. Redundancy analysis and pathway analysis revealed a complex interplay of various environmental and biological factors by explaining the spatiotemporal variations in bacterial communities. Adaptive reservoir management strategies should consider carefully the effects of water stratification and mixing, together with the distribution patterns of aquatic microorganisms.},

abstract = {Soils act as sources and sinks for greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Since both storage and emission capacities may be large, precise quantifications are needed to obtain reliable global budgets that are necessary for land-use management (agriculture, forestry), global change and for climate research. This paper discusses exclusively the soil emission-related processes and their influencing parameters. It reviews soil emission studies involving the most important land-cover types and climate zones and introduces important measuring systems for soil emissions. It addresses current shortcomings and the obvious bias towards northern hemispheric data. When using a conservative average of 300 mg CO 2 e m −2 h −1 (based on our literature review), this leads to global annual net soil emissions of ≥350 Pg CO 2 e (CO 2 e = CO 2 equivalents = total effect of all GHG normalized to CO 2). This corresponds to roughly 21{\%} of the global soil C and N pools. For comparison, 33.4 Pg CO 2 are being emitted annually by fossil fuel combustion and the cement industry.},

abstract = {Soil respiration - Rs, the flux of CO2 from the soil to the atmosphere - is probably the least well constrained component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Here we introduce the SRDB database, a near-universal compendium of published Rs data, and make it available to the scientific community both as a traditional static archive and as a dynamic community database that may be updated over time by interested users. The database encompasses all published studies that report one of the following data measured in the field (not laboratory): annual Rs, mean seasonal Rs, a seasonal or annual partitioning of Rs into its sources fluxes, Rs temperature response (Q10), or R s at 10 °C. Its orientation is thus to seasonal and annual fluxes, not shorter-term or chamber-specific measurements. To date, data from 818 studies have been entered into the database, constituting 3379 records. The data span the measurement years 1961-2007 and are dominated by temperate, well-drained forests. We briefly examine some aspects of the SRDB data - its climate space coverage, mean annual Rs fluxes and their correlation with other carbon fluxes, Rs variability, temperature sensitivities, and the partitioning of Rs source flux - and suggest some potential lines of research that could be explored using these data. The SRDB database is available online in a permanent archive as well as via a project-hosting repository; the latter source leverages open-source software technologies to encourage wider participation in the database's future development. Ultimately, we hope that the updating of, and corrections to, the SRDB will become a shared project, managed by the users of these data in the scientific community. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {This study aims at investigating decomposition processes in wetlands that are daily or seasonally exposed to intermittent oxic and anoxic conditions. We hypothesized that in wetland ecosystems where anoxia regularly establishes, decomposition rates are not affected by oxygen shortage, especially when nitrates are available. Monitoring and experiments were performed from December 2003 to January 2005 in one of the widest (81 ha) freshwater wetlands in the Po river floodplain (Natural Reserve Paludi del Busatello, Italy). Intact sediment cores were sampled on a seasonal basis. Sediment–water fluxes of oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon, methane, and inorganic nitrogen were determined under oxic and anoxic conditions. Oxic–anoxic transitions always resulted in enhanced ammonium, dissolved inorganic carbon, and methane effluxes. At high temperatures, the methane release from sediments was inversely related to both nitrate concentrations and uptake. Likely, nitrate can compensate for the oxygen deficiency while maintaining an oxidative metabolism, either supporting microbial decomposition as an electron acceptor or stimulating the oxidation of the byproducts of the anaerobic metabolism, e.g., methane. This is a key point as the number of temperate wetlands with concurrent nitrate pollution and oxygen shortage is increasing throughout the world.},

abstract = {Recent hypotheses, based on atmospheric records and models, suggest that permafrost carbon (PF-C) accumulated during the last glaciation may have been an important source for the atmospheric CO2 rise during post-glacial warming. However, direct physical indications for such PF-C release have so far been absent. Here we use the Laptev Sea (Arctic Ocean) as an archive to investigate PF-C destabilization during the last glacial–interglacial period. Our results show evidence for massive supply of PF-C from Siberian soils as a result of severe active layer deepening in response to the warming. Thawing of PF-C must also have brought about an enhanced organic matter respiration and, thus, these findings suggest that PF-C may indeed have been an important source of CO2 across the extensive permafrost domain. The results challenge current paradigms on the post-glacial CO2 rise and, at the same time, serve as a harbinger for possible consequences of the present-day warming of PF-C soils. Atmospheric CO2 increases during the last deglaciation have been linked to the destabilisation of permafrost carbon reservoirs. Here, using a sediment core from the Laptev Sea, Tesi et al. indicate a massive supply of permafrost carbon was released from Siberia following active layer deepening.},

abstract = {A new high-resolution spectrofluorimetric probe and an automatic water-quality monitoring station (AWQMS) have been used to record seasonal variations in the spatial distribution of three functional groups of phytoplankton in a Mediterranean water-supply reservoir. In comparison with classical methods, the combined use of these innovative techniques enables development of faster and less laborious spatial distribution surveys, thus favouring higher-frequency and spatially more detailed measurements, and, consequently, a better understanding of phytoplankton dynamics. The results show that the observed variations can be explained by the interaction between the buoyancy properties of the phytoplankton and the mixing characteristics of the reservoir. During the winter, when the lake was isothermal and the phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms, there was no significant spatial variation. In the spring, when the phytoplankton was dominated by chlorophytes there was also very little variation but some motile species formed patches when the wind speed was low. The most pronounced non-uniform distributions of phytoplankton were observed during the summer when the phytoplankton community was dominated by positively buoyant cyanobacteria. Then there was a very strong link between the vertical and horizontal gradients which were also related to the prevailing meteorological conditions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.},

abstract = {The Aral Sea in 1960 was a huge brackish water lake (4th in the world in surface area) lying amidst the deserts of Central Asia. The sea supported a major fishery and functioned as a key regional transportation route. Since 1960, the Aral has undergone rapid desiccation and salinization, overwhelmingly the result of unsustainable expansion of irrigation that dried up its two tributary rivers the Amu Darya and Syr Darya and severely damaged their deltas. The desiccation of the Aral Sea has had severe negative impacts, including, among others, the demise of commercial fishing, devastation of the floral and faunal biodiversity of the native ecosystems of the Syr and Amu deltas, and increased frequency and strength of salt/dust storms. However, efforts have been and are being made to partially restore the sea's hydrology along with its biodiversity, and economic value. The northern part of the Aral has been separated from the southern part by a dike and dam, leading to a level rise and lower salinity. This allowed native fishes to return from the rivers and revitalized the fishing industry. Partial preservation of the Western Basin of the southern Aral Sea may be possible, but these plans need much further environmental and economic analysis. This paper, mainly utilizing hydrologic and other data as input to spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel)-based hydrologic and salinity models, examines the current efforts to restore the Aral and looks at several future scenarios of the Sea. It also delineates the most important lessons of the Aral Sea's drying.},

abstract = {Planktonic metabolism in a Mediterranean reservoir during a near-surface cyanobacterial bloom Summer blooms of large, filamentous, nitrogen-fixing and potentially toxic cyanobacteria are characteristic of many productive , warm monomictic reservoirs in the Mediterranean region, where they constitute stable assemblages. The accumulation of positively buoyant cyanobacteria at the surface layers of the water column favours-among others-the interception of light, inorganic carbon and nitrogen fluxes from the atmosphere, giving these prokaryotes a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton groups. Cyanobacterial blooms can cause deleterious effects to water quality and reservoir ecosystem services. Although the structure of the plankton community in reservoirs during cyanobacterial blooms is a well-known limnological issue, few studies have been undertaken on its functional characteristics. In this study, we used a high-resolution autonomous monitoring system to investigate the short-term changes in gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP) and community respiration (R) in the near-surface waters of a Mediterranean reservoir during a dense summer cyanobacterial bloom. Our results demonstrate that during the bloom, the surface waters of the reservoir showed a well-balanced planktonic metabolism, with a mean GPP:R ratio not significantly different than 1 and therefore close positive correlations between GPP and R. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the daily integrated incident light and the NEP:GPP ratio, while the mixed-layer depth and NEP:GPP ratio were negatively correlated, suggesting a central role for physical processes in the control of community metabolism and the persistence of the cyanobacterial bloom. The implications for the bloom stability and relevance for reservoir water quality management are noted.

abstract = {In this study we assess the suitability of a recently introduced analog-based Model Output Statistics (MOS) downscaling method (referred to as MOS-Analog) for climate change studies and compare the results with a quantile mapping bias correction method. To this aim, we focus on Spain and consider daily precipitation output from an ensemble of Regional Climate Models provided by the ENSEMBLES project. The reanalysis-driven Regional Climate Model (RCM) data provide the historical data (with day-today correspondence with observations induced by the forcing boundary conditions) to conduct the analog search of the control (20C3M) and future (A1B) global climate model (GCM)-driven RCM values. First, we show that the MOS-Analog method outperforms the raw RCM output in the control 20C3M scenario (period 1971-2000) for all considered regions and precipitation indices, although for the worst-performing models the method is less effective. Second, we show that the MOS-Analog method broadly preserves the original RCM climate change signal for different future periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, 2071-2100), except for those indices related to extreme precipitation. This could be explained by the limitation of the analog method to extrapolate unobserved precipitation records. These results suggest that the MOS-Analog is a spatially consistent alternative to standard bias correction methods, although the limitation for extreme values should be taken with caution in cases where this aspect is relevant for the problem.},

abstract = {Lakes and reservoirs globally are experiencing unprecedented changes in land use and climate, depleting dissolved oxygen (DO) in the bottom waters (hypolimnia) of these ecosystems. Because DO is the most energetically favorable terminal electron acceptor (TEA) for organic carbon mineralization, its availability controls the onset of alternate TEA pathways (for example, denitrification, manganese reduction, iron reduction, sulfate reduction, methanogenesis). Low DO concentrations can trigger organic carbon mineralization via alternate TEA pathways in the water column and sediments, which has important implications for greenhouse gas production [carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)]. In this study, we experimentally injected supersaturated DO into the hypolimnion of a eutrophic reservoir and measured concentrations of TEAs and terminal electron products (TEPs) in the experimental reservoir and an upstream reference reservoir. We calculated the electron equivalents yielded from each TEA pathway and estimated the contributions of each TEA pathway to organic carbon processing in both reservoirs. DO additions to the hypolimnion of the experimental reservoir promoted aerobic respiration, suppressing most alternate TEA pathways and resulting in elevated CO2 accumulation. In comparison, organic carbon mineralization in the reference reservoir's anoxic hypolimnion was dominated by alternate TEA pathways, resulting in both CH4 and CO2 accumulation. Our ecosystem-scale experiments demonstrate that the alternate TEA pathways that succeed aerobic respiration in lakes and reservoirs can be manipulated at the ecosystem scale. Moreover, changes in the DO dynamics of freshwater lakes and reservoirs may result in concomitant changes in the redox reactions in the water column that control organic carbon mineralization and greenhouse gas accumulation.},

abstract = {Understanding the hydrological process associated with Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) change is vital for decision-makers in improving human wellbeing. LU/LC change significantly affects the hydrology of the landscape, caused by anthropogenic activities. The scope of this study is to investigate the impact of LU/LC change on the hydrological process of Upper Baro Basin for the years 1987, 2002, and 2017. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used for the simulation of the streamflow. The required data for the SWAT model are soils obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization; Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and LU/LC were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The meteorological data such as Rainfall, Temperature, Sunshine, Humidity, and Wind Speeds were obtained from the Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency. Data on discharge were obtained from Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity. Ecosystems are deemed vital. Landsat images were used to classify the LU/LC pattern using ERDAS Imagine 2014 software and the LU/LC were classified using the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm of Supervised Classification. The Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) global sensitivity method within SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Procedures (SWAT-CUP) was used to identify the most sensitive streamflow parameters. The calibration was carried out using observed streamflow data from 01 January 1990 to 31 December 2002 and a validation period from 01 January 2003 to 31 December 2009. LU/LC analysis shows that there was a drastic decrease of grassland by 15.64{\%} and shrubland by 9.56{\%} while an increase of agricultural land and settlement by 18.01{\%} and 13.01{\%}, respectively, for 30 years. The evaluation of the SWAT model presented that the annual surface runoff increased by 43.53 mm, groundwater flow declined by 27.58 mm, and lateral flow declined by 5.63 mm. The model results showed that the streamflow characteristics changed due to the LU/LC change during the study periods 1987-2017 such as change of flood frequency, increased peak flows, base flow, soil erosion, and annual mean discharge. Curve number, an available water capacity of the soil layer, and soil evaporation composition factor were the most sensitive parameters identified for the streamflow. Both the calibration and validation results disclosed a good agreement between measured and simulated streamflow. The performance of the model statistical test shows the coefficient of determination (R2) and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency values 0.87 and 0.81 for calibration periods of 1990-2002 and 0.84 and 0.76 for the validation period of 2003 to 2009, respectively. Overall, LU/LC significantly affected the hydrological condition of the watershed. Therefore, different conservation strategies to maintain the stability and resilience of the ecosystem are vital.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (OM) is an important factor for maintaining the productivity and the stability of the so-called Caldenal woodland ecosystem of central Argentina. Little is known about the influence of tree coverage and soil texture on OM accumulation in soils of the study region. The relationships between OM content, silt clay content, and the percent of tree coverage were studied in a 25 × 25 m grid in 2 sites. Results showed that OM was lower (P {\textless} 0.05) at Site I (2.86{\%}) than at Site II (6.41{\%}). The OM was positively correlated with the percent of tree coverage in Site I (OM = 0.0156 trees cover 1.97, R2 = 0.29, P {\textless} 0.001), but not in Site II. Conversely, a positive correlation with silt clay was observed in Site II (OM = 0.17 silt clay − 6.79, R2 = 0.41, P {\textless} 0.05) but not in Site I. A multiple regression analysis [OM = − 16.64 0.71 (silt clay) 0.04 (tree coverage), n = 78, R2 = 0.55, P {\textless} 0.001] tended to confirm these results. Although they differed in their relative weight both silt clay and tree coverage affect OM accumulation at both sites. The larger influence of trees on OM variability at Site I was attributed to the lower, but highly variable, tree coverage, and the stronger influence of silt clay on OM variability at Site II can be attributed to the lower variability of tree coverage, and the higher variability of soil texture.According to our results, (a) 41{\%} of OM variability is explained by silt clay content when tree coverage is dense and uniform, and (b) a 29{\%} of OM variability is explained by tree coverage when such coverage is sparse and heterogeneous. The influence of tree canopy on OM distribution could be explained by its effect on the temperature regime. The influence of soil texture on OM could be attributed to its effect on the water retention capacity of soils. While forest clearing increases the maximum temperature and the temperature amplitude of soils, erosion in cleared areas affects soil texture, and consequently, its water retention capacity. The deterioration of both temperature and soil water regimes deteriorates, in turn, the capacity of the soil to accumulate OM.},

Measurements using gas traps indicated very high ebullition rates, but due to the stochastic nature of ebullition a mass balance approach was crucial to deduce system-wide methane sources and losses. Methane diffusion from the sediment was generally low and seasonally stable and did not account for the high concentration of dissolved methane measured in the reservoir discharge. A strong positive correlation between water temperature and the observed dissolved methane concentration enabled us to quantify the dissolved methane addition from bubble dissolution using a system-wide mass balance. Finally, knowing the contribution due to bubble dissolution, we used a bubble model to estimate bubble emission directly to the atmosphere. Our results indicated that the total methane emission from Lake Wohlen was on average {\textgreater}150 mg CH4 m-2 d -1, which is the highest ever documented for a midlatitude reservoir. The substantial temperature-dependent methane emissions discovered in this 90-year-old reservoir indicate that temperate water bodies can be an important but overlooked methane source. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Nitrogen loading from developed watersheds to aquatic ecosystems can stimulate microbial denitrification, a process that reduces nitrate (NO-3) to dinitrogen (N2) or nitrous oxide (N2O), the latter a potent greenhouse gas. While aquatic ecosystems are a globally significant source of N2O to the atmosphere, the relationship between denitrification and N2O production is not well known. Until recently, this field of research has been limited by the technical challenges of simultaneously measuring denitrification and N2O production or consumption in situ at the ecosystem scale. Here we use membrane inlet mass spectrometry, an analytical method providing precise and accurate measurements of dissolved N2, and gas chromatography to directly measure N2 and N2O concentrations in the hypolimnion of a stratified reservoir draining an agricultural watershed. Denitrification resulted in a consistent increase in dissolved N2 and decrease in NO-3concentrations in the hypolimnion during the 5 month period of stratification, though temporal patterns in dissolved N2O concentrations were less consistent. Denitrification alternated between an N2O source and sink, with the N2O yield, defined as the relative production of N2O to N2 via denitrification, ranging from -3.4{\%} (i.e., net N2O consumption) to 19.5{\%} (mean = -0.03{\%}). Whereas denitrification in the hypolimnion functioned as a small N2O sink during the stratified period, the reservoir was an N2O source on an annual time scale. Additional studies across reservoirs of different sizes, trophic status, and ages are needed to resolve the role of reservoirs in the global N2O budget. {\textcopyright} 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Eutrophication increases hypoxia in lakes and reservoirs, causing deleterious effects on biological communities. Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: One in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

abstract = {The emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from the Petit Saut hydroelectric reservoir (Sinnamary River, French Guiana) to the atmosphere were quantified for 10 years since impounding in 1994. Diffusive emissions from the reservoir surface were computed from direct flux measurements in 1994, 1995, and 2003 and from surface concentrations monitoring. Bubbling emissions, which occur only at water depths lower than 10 m, were interpolated from funnel measurements in 1994, 1997, and 2003. Degassing at the outlet of the dam downstream of the turbines was calculated from the difference in gas concentrations upstream and downstream of the dam and the turbined discharge. Diffusive emissions from the Sinnamary tidal river and estuary were quantified from direct flux measurements in 2003 and concentrations monitoring. Total carbon emissions were 0.37 ± 0.01 Mt yr-1 C (CO2 emissions, 0.30 ± 0.02; CH4 emissions, 0.07 ± 0.01) the first 3 years after impounding (1994-1996) and then decreased to 0.12 ± 0.01 Mt yr-1 C (CO2, 0.10 ± 0-01; CH4, 0.016 ± 0.006) since 2000. On average over the 10 years, 61{\%} of the CO2 emissions occurred by diffusion from the reservoir surface, 31{\%} from the estuary, 7{\%} by degassing at the outlet of the dam, and a negligible fraction by bubbling. CH4 diffusion and bubbling from the reservoir surface were predominant (40{\%} and 44{\%}, respectively) only the first year after impounding. Since 1995, degassing at an aerating weir downstream of the turbines has become the major pathway for CH4 emissions, reaching 70{\%} of the total CH4 flux. In 2003, river carbon inputs were balanced by carbon outputs to the ocean and were about 3 times lower than the atmospheric flux, which suggests that 10 years after impounding, the flooded terrestrial carbon is still the predominant contributor to the gaseous emissions. In 10 years, about 22{\%} of the 10 Mt C flooded was lost to the atmosphere. Our results confirm the significance of greenhouse gas emissions from tropical reservoir but stress the importance of: (1) considering all the gas pathways upstream and downstream of the dams and (2) taking into account the reservoir age when upscaling emissions rates at the global scale.

abstract = {Constructed lakes and impoundments (reservoirs) likely exhibit substantial differences in their physics, chemistry, and biology from naturally formed lakes; however, because reservoirs and natural lakes generally have different latitudinal distributions, less is known about quantitative, generalized differences between the 2 waterbody types. We compared a suite of limnological variables among 1033 reservoirs and natural lakes across multiple size classes on a latitudinal gradient in the conterminous United States. In general, reservoirs had significantly greater perimeters, catchment areas, and catchment area:surface area ratios than natural lakes. Interestingly, several lakeshore land use, morphometric, and water quality response variables exhibited significant interactions between waterbody type and latitude. Southern reservoirs were deeper and had higher proportions of forested land and less agriculture and developed land use in their lakeshore than southern natural lakes, whereas northern reservoirs were shallower and had less forest and more agriculture and developed land in their lakeshore than northern natural lakes. Following the waterbody depth and land use data, natural lakes also had greater total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and shallower Secchi disk depths at lower latitudes, whereas reservoirs had greater TP concentrations and shallower Secchi disk depths at higher latitudes. Overall, natural lakes were more eutrophic than reservoirs, having greater total nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations, regardless of latitude. Our findings indicate that many physical, chemical, and lakeshore land use characteristics of reservoirs and natural lakes vary on a latitudinal gradient, which has implications for the water quality, ecology, and management of these waterbodies.},

abstract = {Methane (CH4) emissions from reservoirs are responsible for most of the atmospheric climatic forcing of these aquatic ecosystems, comparable to emissions from paddies or biomass burning. Primarily, CH4 is produced during the anaerobic mineralization of organic carbon in anoxic sediments by methanogenic archaea. However, the origin of the recurrent and ubiquitous CH4 supersaturation in oxic waters (i.e., the methane paradox) is still controversial. Here, we determined the dissolved CH4 concentration in the water column of 12 reservoirs during summer stratification and winter mixing to explore CH4 sources in oxic waters. Reservoir sizes ranged from 1.18 to 26.13 km2. We found that dissolved CH4 in the water column varied by up to 4 orders of magnitude (0.02-213.64 ?mol L1), and all oxic depths were consistently supersaturated in both periods. Phytoplanktonic sources appear to determine the concentration of CH4 in these reservoirs primarily. In anoxic waters, the depth-cumulative chlorophyll a concentration, a proxy for the phytoplanktonic biomass exported to sediments, was correlated to CH4 concentration. In oxic waters, the photosynthetic picoeukaryotes abundance was significantly correlated to the dissolved CH4 concentration during both the stratification and the mixing. The mean depth of the reservoirs, as a surrogate of the vertical CH4 transport from sediment to the oxic waters, also contributed notably to the CH4 concentration in oxic waters. Our findings suggest that photosynthetic picoeukaryotes can play a significant role in determining CH4 concentration in oxic waters, although their role as CH4 sources to explain the methane paradox has been poorly explored.},

abstract = {Inland waters were recently recognized to be important sources of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, and including inland water emissions in large scale greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets may potentially offset the estimated carbon sink in many areas. However, the lack of GHG flux measurements and well-defined inland water areas for extrapolation, make the magnitude of the potential offset unclear. This study presents coordinated flux measurements of CH4 and CO2 in multiple lakes, ponds, rivers, open wells, reservoirs, springs, and canals in India. All these inland water types, representative of common aquatic ecosystems in India, emitted substantial amounts of CH4 and a major fraction also emitted CO2. The total CH4 flux (including ebullition and diffusion) from all the 45 systems ranged from 0.01 to 52.1 mmol m-2 d-1, with a mean of 7.8 ± 12.7 (mean ± 1 SD) mmol m-2 d-1. The mean surface water CH4 concentration was 3.8 ± 14.5 $\mu$m (range 0.03-92.1 $\mu$m). The CO2 fluxes ranged from -28.2 to 262.4 mmol m-2 d-1 and the mean flux was 51.9 ± 71.1 mmol m-2 d-1. The mean partial pressure of CO2 was 2927 ± 3269 $\mu$atm (range: 400-11 467 $\mu$atm). Conservative extrapolation to whole India, considering the specific area of the different water types studied, yielded average emissions of 2.1 Tg CH4 yr-1 and 22.0 Tg CO2 yr-1 from India's inland waters. When expressed as CO2 equivalents, this amounts to 75 Tg CO2 equivalents yr-1 (53-98 Tg CO2 equivalents yr-1; ± 1 SD), with CH4 contributing 71{\%}. Hence, average inland water GHG emissions, which were not previously considered, correspond to 42{\%} (30-55{\%}) of the estimated land carbon sink of India. Thereby this study illustrates the importance of considering inland water GHG exchange in large scale assessments.},

abstract = {Ten lakes studied in this investigation and the data presented by previous authors are all consistent with the hypothesis that rates of oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion of lakes do not depend upon the ambient oxygen concentration over the range of concentrations from 12 mg/L to 1.0 mg/L. By definition, aerobic respiration must stop when there is no more oxygen present. Therefore the hypolimnetic oxygen deficit can be modeled as a zero‐order chemical process that is independent of oxygen concentration. Predictions of seasonal changes in hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations can be made by estimating the slope of the linear regression of oxygen concentration against the Julian day when the sample was collected.

abstract = {Changes in meteorological patterns to drier conditions alter the hydrodynamic processes of reservoirs and can affect their thermal structure. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of a severe drought period on the hydrodynamics of a tropical reservoir. One-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling was applied from 2009 to 2016 to simulate the thermal dynamics of the highly drought-impacted Serra Azul reservoir, a drinking water supply reservoir located in southeast Brazil. After calibration (r = 0.91, root mean square error [RMSE] = 1.33 °C) and validation of the model (r = 0.87, RMSE = 2.06 °C), physical indicators were calculated to evaluate the stratification and mixing processes in the water column. Results showed that the reservoir hydrodynamics were affected by the drought period through an increase in mixing frequency and duration. Negative implications for water quality are expected, such as higher concentration of dissolved substances and nutrients and increased turbidity, salinity, and electrical conductivity, as observed in most lakes and reservoirs subjected to drought. Different water withdrawal scenarios were simulated, and a critical water withdrawal volume that could prevent drought impacts on the Serra Azul reservoir thermal regime was identified. This study indicates the need for managers to understand potential impacts of extreme meteorological events in reservoir dynamics, particularly when the reservoirs are part of drinking water systems.},

Whilst ensemble (multi-)modelling approaches have been used for a number of years to improve the robustness of weather forecasts this approach has until now never been adopted for ecosystem modelling. We show that the average simulated phytoplankton biomass derived from three different aquatic ecosystem models is generally superior to any of the three individual models in describing observed phytoplankton biomass in a typical temperate lake ecosystem, and we simulate a series of climate change projections. While this is the first multi-model ensemble approach applied for some of the most complex aquatic ecosystem models available, we consider it sets a precedent for what will become commonplace methodology in the future, as it enables increased robustness of model projections, and scenario uncertainty estimation due to differences in model structures.},

abstract = {A freely available dataset produced from three million Landsat satellite images reveals substantial changes in the distribution of global surface water over the past 32 years and their causes, from climate change to human actions. The distribution of surface water has been mapped globally, and local-to-regional studies have tracked changes over time. But to date, there has been no global and methodologically consistent quantification of changes in surface water over time. Jean-Fran{\c{c}}ois Pekel and colleagues have analysed more than three million Landsat images to quantify month-to-month changes in surface water at a resolution of 30 metres and over a 32-year period. They find that surface waters have declined by almost 90,000 square kilometres—largely in the Middle East and Central Asia—but that surface waters equivalent to about twice that area have been created elsewhere. Drought, reservoir creation and water extraction appear to have driven most of the changes in surface water over the past decades. The location and persistence of surface water (inland and coastal) is both affected by climate and human activity1 and affects climate2,3, biological diversity4 and human wellbeing5,6. Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions7, statistical extrapolation of regional data8 and satellite imagery9,10,11,12, but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images13, we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change14 is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal15,16. Losses in Australia17 and the USA18 linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent, validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.},

abstract = {Shallow fresh water bodies in peat areas are important contributors to greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere. In this study we determined the magnitude of CH4 and CO2 fluxes from 12 water bodies in Dutch wetlands during the summer season and studied the factors that might regulate emissions of CH4 and CO2 from these lakes and ditches. The lakes and ditches acted as CO2 and CH4 sources of emissions to the atmosphere; the fluxes from the ditches were significantly larger than the fluxes from the lakes. The mean greenhouse gas flux from ditches and lakes amounted to 129.1 ± 8.2 (mean ± SE) and 61.5 ± 7.1 mg m-2 h-1 for CO2 and 33.7 ± 9.3 and 3.9 ± 1.6 mg m-2 h-1 for CH4, respectively. In most water bodies CH4 was the dominant greenhouse gas in terms of warming potential. Trophic status of the water and the sediment was an important factor regulating emissions. By using multiple linear regression 87{\%} of the variation in CH4 could be explained by PO43- concentration in the sediment and Fe2+ concentration in the water, and 89{\%} of the CO2 flux could be explained by depth, EC and pH of the water. Decreasing the nutrient loads and input of organic substrates to ditches and lakes by for example reducing application of fertilizers and manure within the catchments and decreasing upward seepage of nutrient rich water from the surrounding area will likely reduce summer emissions of CO2 and CH4 from these water bodies. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Inland waters, particularly small and shallow lakes, are significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) to the atmosphere. However, the spatial in-lake heterogeneity of CO 2 and CH 4 production processes and their drivers in the sediment remain poorly studied. We measured potential CO 2 and CH 4 production in slurry incubations from 12 sites within the small and shallow crater lake Windsborn in Germany, as well as fluxes at the water-atmosphere interface of intact sediment core incubations from four sites. Production rates were highly variable and ranged from 7.2 to 38.5 µmol CO 2 gC −1 d −1 and from 5.4 to 33.5 µmol CH 4 gC −1 d −1. Fluxes ranged from 4.5 to 26.9 mmol CO 2 m −2 d −1 and from 0 to 9.8 mmol CH 4 m −2 d −1. Both CO 2 and CH 4 production rates and the CH 4 fluxes exhibited a significant and negative correlation (p{\textless}0.05, $\rho${\textless} − 0.6) with a prevalence of recalcitrant organic matter (OM) compounds in the sediment as identified by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. The carbon / nitrogen ratio exhibited a significant negative correlation (p{\textless}0.01, $\rho$ = −0.88) with CH 4 fluxes but not with production rates or CO 2 fluxes. The availability of inorganic (nitrate, sulfate, ferric iron) and organic (humic acids) electron acceptors failed to explain differences in CH 4 production rates, assuming a competitive suppression, but observed non-methanogenic CO 2 production could be explained up to 91 {\%} by prevalent electron acceptors. We did not find clear relationships between OM quality, the thermodynamics of methanogenic pathways (acetoclastic vs. hydrogenotrophic) and electron-accepting capacity of the OM. Differences in CH 4 fluxes were interestingly to a large part explained by grain size distribution (p{\textless}0.05, $\rho$ = ±0.65). Surprisingly though, sediment gas storage, potential production rates and water-atmosphere fluxes were decoupled from each other and did not show any correlations. Our results show that within a small lake, sediment CO 2 and CH 4 production shows significant spatial variability which is mainly driven by spatial differences in the degradability of the sediment OM. We highlight that studies on production rates and sediment quality need to be interpreted with care, though, in terms of deducing emission rates and patterns as approaches based on production rates only neglect physical sediment properties and production and oxidation processes in the water column as major controls on actual emissions.},

abstract = {1. The near-surface distribution of phytoplankton cells along the thalweg of a canyon- shaped reservoir (El Gergal, southern Spain) during two surveys is described and interpreted as the result of time-varying large-scale circulation patterns, vertical mixing processes and the physiological capacity of algal cells to regulate its position in the water column. 2. Vertical gradients of chlorophyll-a concentration developed in the water column during the day but disappeared at night, as a result of the shoaling and deepening of the diurnal mixed layer (dml). The changes in the depth of the dml are largely controlled in El Gergal by convectively driven mixing processes. The longitudinal circulation changes, in turn, as a result of weak and diurnal land-sea breezes. The distribution of algal cells was patchy at all times but did not change during any of the surveys. 3. An expression is proposed to estimate time scales for the development of horizontal patchiness TP based on simple concepts of transport. It is shown that TP is in the order of a week, indicating that horizontal patchiness does not respond immediately to hourly changes in the controlling factors. The magnitude of TP, though, depends on how the vertical distribution of chlorophyll-a and longitudinal currents change on subdiurnal time scales. In particular, TP is sensitive to the lag existing between the momentum and heat fluxes through the free surface, driving circulation and vertical mixing.},

abstract = {The change in the stratification pattern in Boadella Reservoir (Catalonia, Spain) due to the switch in water withdrawal was investigated for a 6-month period in the year 2000. A numerical one-dimensional model (DLM) was used to predict the thermal structure of the reservoir during the period of maximum water demand. The model was found to satisfactorily predict the basic trends of the thermal stratification of the water column of the reservoir. We used this model to investigate various possible water withdrawal scenarios. When thermal stratification has been completely developed, the location of the main thermocline coincides with the depth of the outlet, in the various withdrawal scenarios considered. The possible effect of the switch between outlets on the water quality of the reservoir is discussed.},

abstract = {Plankton are typically divided into phytoplankton and zooplankton in marine ecosystem models. Yet, most protists in the photic zone engage in some degree of phagotrophy, and it has been suggested that trophic strategy is really a continuum between pure phototrophs (phytoplankton) and pure phagotrophs (unicellular zooplankton). Such a continuum of trophic strategies is well represented by trait-based modelling techniques. A key model ingredient is the size of individual cells, as size constrains affinities for nutrient uptake, photosynthesis and active encounter with other cells. We outline a general trait-based model of a unicellular planktonic organism where size is a central trait and where nutrient uptake, photosynthesis and phagotrophy are determined by investments into these functions and by the physical constraints imposed by organism size. This framework provides simple predictions of how trophic strategy correlates with size.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t We determined the rates of photosynthesis and respiration in batch cultures of 22 marine phytoplankton species from five phyla covering a range of 7 orders of magnitude in cell size. Rates were determined during the exponential growth phase and also during the stationary phase, when cell growth was limited by nitrogen availability. We observed, in all growth phases, a curvature in the size scaling of carbon fixation, such that the relationship between carbon-specific photosynthesis and cell size was unimodal, with the highest rates being measured in intermediate-size species. The log–log relationship between individual metabolic rates and cell size showed an overall lineal pattern with a slope equal or near 1, irrespective of whether volume or carbon is used as a metric for cell size. Thus, our results demonstrate that when small species (b 50 $\mu$m 3 cell diameter) are considered together with intermediate-and large-sized species phytoplankton metabolism does not follow Kleiber's 3/4-power rule. Considering all species together, respiration losses represented on average 9{\%} and 22{\%} of total carbon fixation during the exponential growth and stationary phases, respectively. Carbon-specific respiration was largely independent of cell size and growth phase, but tended to take higher values in the dinoflagellates. During the stationary growth phase, and contrary to other groups, most diatoms were able to maintain carbon fixation rates similar to those measured during exponential growth. Our results highlight the ability of intermediate-to-large size species to sustain high metabolic rates in spite of their cell size, which helps to explain why they dominate phytoplankton blooms in the ocean.},

abstract = {Free-water measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) in lakes are becoming common and provide opportunities for estimating ecosystem processes, such as gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R). The models used to estimate metabolism often subsume biological processes into one parameter each for GPP and R. However, high-frequency DO observations made over days show diverse patterns at multiple time scales, suggesting a complex suite of processes controls DO dynamics. Can we improve metabolism estimates and predictive ability for DO at diel scales by adding complexity to the models? In this study, we use data from two north temperate lakes to test a variety of metabolism models representing a suite of non-linear metabolic processes. To test whether alternative models can be discriminated, we simulated DO with assumed parameter values and auto-regressive noise, and fit the models to the simulated DO. The most complex model could be discriminated from simpler models and provided the most accurate and precise predictions. However, when models were fit to observed DO data from the sensor network, the simplest model predicted DO as well as the most complex one. The added complexity did not improve model performance. An analysis of the model residuals indicates that physics may explain some of the DO pattern not predicted, especially high-frequency oscillations and anomalies that appear to coincide with weather patterns. Under reasonably stable weather conditions and at scales of a few days, simple metabolism models explain the bulk of diel DO variability.},

abstract = {The occurrence and importance of photoautotrophic picoplankton (PPP, cells with a diameter {\textless}2 $\mu$m) was studied along a trophic and salinity gradient in hypersaline lakes of the Transylvanian Basin (Romania). The studied lakes were found to be rich in PPP, with abundances (maximum 7.6 × 10(6) cells mL(-1)) higher than in freshwater and marine environments of similar trophic conditions. The contribution of PPP to the total phytoplankton biovolume did not decrease with increasing trophic state as it was generally found in other aquatic environments. Regardless of the trophic conditions, the contribution of PPP could reach 90-100 {\%} in these hypersaline lakes. We hypothesized that the PPP predominance might be the result of the low grazing pressure, since heterotrophic nanoflagellates (the main grazers of PPP) were absent in the studied samples. There were significant differences in community composition among the lakes along the salinity gradient. CyPPP predominated in less saline waters (mainly below 5 {\%}), while EuPPP were present along the entire salinity range (up to 18.7 {\%}), dominating the phytoplankton between 3 and 13 {\%} salinity. Above 13 {\%} salinity, the phytoplankton was composed mainly of Dunaliella species.},

This review focuses on the relationships among the components of picophytoplankton (picocyanobacteria and the picoplanktic eukaryotes) and biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The dynamics of picophytoplankton in aquatic ecosystems are strictly dependent upon basin size and trophy, temperature, and nutrient and light limitation, but they are also regulated by grazing and viral-induced lysis. The review considers: the pros and cons of the molecular approach to the study of the taxonomy of freshwater Synechococcus spp.; the importance of ecological aspects in understanding the puzzle of picophytoplankton phylogeny (genotype vs ecotype); and the role of biotic vs abiotic interactions in controlling picophytoplankton dynamics. Biotic, top- down control mechanisms are reviewed as well as knowledge of other biological interactions.},

abstract = {An analytical setup for respiration rate measurements was developed and evaluated in pelagic water samples using a commercially available optical oxygen sensor (Optode™). This setup required the development of a gas tight stopper to connect the sensors to a 1 dm3 glass sample bottle, precise temperature control (± 0.05°C), and proper stirring of samples. The detection limit and precision of the method was 0.3 mmol O2 m–3 d–1 . This was similar to the detection limit for the high-precision Winkler titration method reported in field studies. When compared with the Winkler method, the Optode sensor enabled operator-independent, high temporal resolu- tion measurement of respiration, better coverage of plankton groups and detection of non-linear oxygen decline, without the need for wet chemistry. Respiration rates measured by the Optodes showed good accuracy when compared with measurements made with the Winkler titration method (3{\%} deviation), followed the expected temperature response (Q10 = 3.0), were correlated with chlorophyll a and were congruent with earlier reported values in the literature. The main source of uncertainty was a necessary correction for system drift dur- ing the incubation period, due to oxygen release from the plastic components. Additionally, less stringent tem- perature control on board research vessels during rough seas reduced the precision. We conclude that the devel- oped Optode system can be used to measure respiration in productive coastal waters. Samples from cold or deep waters were, however, often below the detection limit.},

abstract = {The dissolved oxygen concentrations in Darwin River Reservoir (DRR) and Manton River Reservoir (MRR), both located in the wet/dry tropics of Australia, were investigated over an 8-year period. Average oxygen concentrations were lower in MRR than in DRR, indicating the dominance of consumptive processes not compensated by photosynthetic production of oxygen, despite MRR's higher chlorophyll a concentration. With the onset of thermal stratification, dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion of each reservoir was depleted at average rates of 3.4-7.1 mg L-1 month-1. These are higher than rates reported for temperate water-bodies (0.10-3.0 mg L-1 month-1). This was ascribed primarily to the effect of temperature on microbial metabolism, while the influence of the reservoirs' high epilimnion to hypolimnion volumetric ratios (approximately 10:1) and reservoir trophic state were considered secondary. Due to the temperature dependence of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, the trophic classification of lakes based on hypolimnetic deoxygenation and anoxia is not globally applicable, but is applicable to water-bodies of similar hypolimnetic temperatures, especially when morphometric influences are also taken into account. Both reservoirs experienced long periods of anoxia (average: 9 months in MRR, 5 months in DRR). In DRR, the extent of hypolimnetic anoxia was related to hypolimnion volume. Hypolimnetic anoxia in the reservoirs, when quantified by the anoxic factor (AF; number of days that a sediment area, equal to the whole-lake surface area, is overlain by anoxic waters), was high compared with similar water-bodies in North America, providing quantitative evidence that anoxia in more prevalent in tropical reservoirs. Ammonia, iron and manganese accumulated in the hypolimnion of both DRR and MRR, with concentrations decreasing exponentially from the sediments to the oxycline. Sediment phosphorus release was detected in MRR, but not detected in DRR, despite the reservoir's long periods of hypolimnetic anoxia. The high water temperatures and lengthy periods of hypolimnetic anoxia of the reservoirs provided a favourable environment for anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria.},

abstract = {El Gergal is the last link in a system of reservoirs located in the Rivera de Huelva River, Seville (South-West Spain). Because of its position within the system and the different water transfer possibilities between reservoirs, the florisitic composition of phytoplankton in El Gergal can be strongly influenced by the concentration of cells present in the water transferred from other reservoirs in the series. In June 2000 a large Ceratium hirundinella inoculums was transferred from an upstream reservoir into El Gergal. The dinoflagellate inoculums entered in the receiving reservoir through the riverine zone depicting a marked horizontal structure, and inducing an intense summer bloom. Our results show that this Ceratium bloom was effective to compete and counteract the later development of the harmful cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Further, after the integration of a set of adaptations to the semi-arid Mediterranean region and subsequently validation, the PROTECH model (a 1D phytoplankton community model) was used to describe, assess and evaluate the potential impact on El Gergal phytoplankton dynamics of an alternative water transfer strategy. Finally, we encourage the use of dynamic modelling in lakes and reservoir management, as it constitutes a powerful tool that should offer reliable predictions and help managers in the usually difficult and complex task of adopting optimal decisions, in order to minimise water treatment costs and provide the best possible environmental quality. {\textcopyright} Asociaci{\'{o}}n Espa{\~{n}}ola de Limnolog{\'{i}}a.},

Mechanistic models of phytoplankton responses to climate change require the parameterization of many processes of which we have limited knowledge. We develop a statistical approach to estimate the response of remote-sensed ocean chlorophyll to a variety of physical and chemical variables. Irradiance over the mixed layer depth, surface nitrate, sea-surface temperature, and latitude and longitude together can predict 83{\%} of the variation in log chlorophyll in the North Atlantic. Light and nitrate regulate biomass through an empirically determined minimum function explaining nearly 50{\%} of the variation in log chlorophyll by themselves and confirming that either light or macronutrients are often limiting and that much of the variation in chlorophyll concentration is determined by bottom-up mechanisms. Assuming the dynamics of the future ocean are governed by the same processes at work today, we should be able to apply these response functions to future climate change scenarios, with changes in temperature, nutrient distributions, irradiance, and ocean physics.},

abstract = {Patterns of phytoplankton size spectra variation with gradients of environmental stress have been observed in freshwater, transitional waters and marine ecosystems, driving the development of size spectra based assessment tools. In this study, we have tested on transitional and coastal waters a new Index of Size spectra Sensitivity of Phytoplankton (ISS-Phyto), which integrates simple size spectra metrics, size class sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance, phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) and taxonomic richness thresholds. ISS-Phyto has been tested both among and within ecosystems along pressure gradients based on expert view assessment; the adequacy of symmetric and both left and right asymmetric models of phytoplankton size class sensitivity have been compared. The results showed that ISS-Phyto consistently discriminated between anthropogenic and natural disturbance conditions. Left asymmetric models of size spectra sensitivity, assuming greater disturbance tolerance with respect to eutrophication and organic enrichment of increasingly large size classes, showed the best fit comparing all ecosystems; in three of the four considered ecosystems (Varna, Helsinki, Momp{\'{a}}s-Pasaia), they seemed to discriminate best between different levels of disturbance also within ecosystems. Moreover, they demonstrated significant and inverse patterns of variation along the overall pressure gradient as well as along the inorganic phosphorus (DIP), chlorophyll a and trophic index (TRIX) gradients. Therefore, ISS-Phyto, originally developed for transitional waters, seems to be an adequate assessment tool of ecological status also in coastal marine waters; moreover, it seems adequate to describe within ecosystem disturbance gradients. Hence, ISS-Phyto helps to understand the relationships between anthropogenic impact and ecosystem response from the individual point of view, with reference to the simple parameter of body size. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent research indicates that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from dry aquatic sediments are a relevant process in the freshwater carbon cycle. However, fluxes are difficult to measure because of the often rocky substrate and the dynamic nature of the habitat. Here we tested the performance of different materials to seal a closed chamber to stony ground both in laboratory and field experiments. Using on-site material consistently resulted in elevated fluxes. The artefact was caused both by outgassing of the material and production of gas. The magnitude of the artefact was site dependent the measured CO 2 flux increased between 10 and 208 {\%}. Errors due to incomplete sealing proved to be more severe than errors due to non-inert sealing material. Pottery clay as sealing material provided a tight seal between the chamber and the ground and no production of gases was detected. With this approach it is possible to get reliable gas fluxes from hard-substrate sites without using a permanent collar. Our test experiments confirmed that CO 2 fluxes from dry aquatic sediments are similar to CO 2 fluxes from terrestrial soils.},

abstract = {We studied temporal dynamics and regulation of oxygen metabolism in the upper mixed layer of a nutrient-rich shallow Danish lake by continuous measurements of oxygen, irradiance, wind, and temperature and frequent measurements of algal chlorophyll, organic pools, and inorganic nutrients. Chlorophyll, algal growth rate, and mean irradiance (Emean) in the mixed surface layer were calculated daily from continuous measurements of irradiance and temperature with depth. There were three to four distinct maxima in gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (R) during the summer season and minima from fall to spring after broad-scale changes in irradiance, temperature, mixing depth, and biomass and growth rate of the algal community and concentrations of inorganic nutrients. Lake metabolism was annually balanced (mean GPP:R 1.04 in 2003 and 1.01 in 2004), with net autotrophy occurring mainly from mid-May to mid-September (mean GPP:R 1.14 in 2003 and 1.10 in 2004), and net heterotrophy outside this period (mean GPP:R 0.60 in 2003 and 0.81 in 2004). However, GPP:R varied two- to threefold from day to day because lower surface irradiance, higher mixing depth, and thus lower Emean significantly reduced GPP. Normalizing GPP to chlorophyll provided an index of algal growth potential (GPPB), which followed a hyperbolic relationship to Emean, and both parameters were related to blooms and collapses of algal biomass. Metabolic rates were much more variable from day to day than algal biomass, which integrates growth and loss processes over longer periods. The continuous approach to lake metabolism provides better data and can provide a more accurate picture than averages of a few discrete measurements. Weekly averages reflected the characteristic seasonal peaks and troughs also observed for algal biomass, whereas monthly averages did not. Daily measurements of lake metabolism, therefore, can provide the optimal background for evaluating temporal changes and regulation of algal biomass and organic pools in nutrient-rich shallow lakes. {\textcopyright} 2007, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

@article{Rassmann2020,
abstract = {Estuarine regions are generally considered a major source of atmospheric CO2, as a result of the high organic carbon (OC) mineralization rates in their water column and sediments. Despite this, the intensity of anaerobic respiration processes in the sediments tempered by the reoxidation of reduced metabolites near the sediment-water interface controls the flux of benthic alkalinity. This alkalinity may partially buffer metabolic CO2 generated by benthic OC respiration in sediments. Thus, sediments with high anaerobic respiration rates could contribute less to local acidification than previously thought. In this study, a benthic chamber was deployed in the Rh{\^{o}}ne River prodelta and the adjacent continental shelf (Gulf of Lion, northwestern Mediterranean) in late summer to assess the fluxes of total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the sediment. Concurrently, in situ O2 and pH micro-profiles, voltammetric profiles and pore water composition were measured in surface sediments to identify the main biogeochemical processes controlling the net production of alkalinity in these sediments. Benthic TA and DIC fluxes to the water column, ranging between 14 and 74 and 18 and 78 mmolm-2 d-1, respectively, were up to 8 times higher than dissolved oxygen uptake (DOU) rates (10:4±0:9 mmolm-2 d-1) close to the river mouth, but their intensity decreased offshore, as a result of the decline in OC inputs. In the zone close to the river mouth, pore water redox species indicated that TA and DIC were mainly produced by microbial sulfate and iron reduction. Despite the complete removal of sulfate from pore waters, dissolved sulfide concentrations were low and significant concentrations of FeS were found, indicating the precipitation and burial of iron sulfide minerals with an estimated burial flux of 12.5 mmolm-2 d-1 near the river mouth. By preventing reduced iron and sulfide reoxidation, the precipitation and burial of iron sulfide increases the alkalinity release from the sediments during the spring and summer months. Under these conditions, the sediment provides a net source of alkalinity to the bottom waters which mitigates the effect of the benthic DIC flux on the carbonate chemistry of coastal waters and weakens the partial pressure of CO2 increase in the bottom waters that would occur if only DIC was produced.},

@article{Olsson2022,
abstract = {Anthropogenic eutrophication caused by excess loading of nutrients, especially phosphorus (P), from catchments is a major cause of lake water quality degradation. The release of P from bed sediments to the water column, termed internal loading, can exceed catchment P load in eutrophic lakes, especially those that stratify during warm summer periods. Managing internal P loading is challenging, and although a range of approaches have been implemented, long-term success is often limited, requiring lake-specific solutions. Here, we assess the manipulation of lake residence time to inhibit internal loading in Elterwater, a shallow stratifying lake in the English Lake District, UK. Since 2016, additional inflowing water has been diverted into the inner basin of Elterwater to reduce its water residence time, with the intention of limiting the length of the stratified period and reducing internal loading. Combining eight years of field data in a Before-After-Control-Impact study with process-based hydrodynamic modelling enabled the quantification of the residence time intervention effects on stratification length, water column stability, and concentrations of chlorophyll a and P. Annual water residence time was reduced during the study period by around 40{\%} (4.9 days). Despite this change, the lake continued to stratify and developed hypolimnetic anoxia. As a result, there was little significant change in phosphorus (as total or soluble reactive phosphorus) or chlorophyll a concentrations. Summer stratification length was 2 days shorter and 7{\%} less stable with the intervention. Our results suggest that the change to water residence time in Elterwater was insufficient to induce large enough physical changes to improve water quality. However, the minor physical changes suggest the management measure had some impact and that larger changes in water residence time may have the potential to induce reductions in internal loading. Future assessments of management requirements should combine multi-year observations and physical lake modelling to provide improved understanding of the intervention effect size required to alter the physical structure of the lake, leading to increased hypolimnetic oxygen and reduced potential for internal loading.},

abstract = {Warming-induced changes in lake thermal and mixing regimes present risks to water quality and ecosystem services provided by U.S. lakes and reservoirs. Modulation of responses by different physical and hydroclimatic settings are not well understood. We explore the potential effects of climate change on 27 lake “archetypes” representative of a range of lakes and reservoirs occurring throughout the U.S. Archetypes are based on different combinations of depth, surface area, and water clarity. LISSS, a one-dimensional dynamic thermal simulation model, is applied to assess lake response to multiple mid-21st century change scenarios applied to nine baseline climate series from different hydroclimatic regions of the U.S. Results show surface water temperature increases of about 77 {\%} of increase in average air temperature change. Bottom temperature changes are less (around 30 {\%}) for deep lakes and in regions that maintain mid-winter air temperatures below freezing. Significant decreases in length of ice cover are projected, and the extent and strength of stratification will increase throughout the U.S., with systematic differences associated with depth, surface area, and clarity. These projected responses suggest a range of future challenges that lake managers are likely to face. Changes in thermal and mixing dynamics suggest increased risk of summer hypoxic conditions and cyanobacterial blooms. Increased water temperatures above the summer thermocline could be a problem for cold water fisheries management in many lakes. Climate-induced changes in water balance and mass inputs of nutrients may further exacerbate the vulnerability of lakes to climate change.},

abstract = {In the context of reservoirs, sediment trapping, and aquatic greenhouse gas (GHG) production, knowledge about the distribution of hot and low spots is essential for improved measurement strategies. It is also a key to a precise assessment of the GHG emissions of each reservoir. Large numbers of reservoirs are used mainly for hydroelectric power generation and, hence, affected by strong changes in water level. Drawdown events may lead to significant changes in spatial sediment and organic carbon distribution and, consequently, strongly alter the GHG emission patterns of the water body. We combined hydroacoustic sediment classification, sediment magnitude detection, and ebullition flux assessment with in-situ pore water investigations and sediment coring to detect ebullition distribution patterns after strong reservoir drawdown. The research was conducted in the Capivari Reservoir in the southeast of Brazil, which was affected by up to 15 m of drawdown within the last 10 years. Results show severe changes in sediment accumulation and composition. The focusing of sediment divides the reservoir in extreme hot and low spots. Methane pore water concentrations are highly correlated with acoustic backscatter values (r2 = 0.97) as well as with the organic carbon content (r2 = 0.55) and allow for a precise detection of the newly created emission patterns. Highly productive sediment could be acoustically distinguished from non-productive areas. Only 23.6{\%} of the reservoir surface produced 64{\%} of the detected bubbles. An organic carbon content in the sediment of 2.4{\%} was found to be a prerequisite for the formation of GHG emission hot spots. These findings may help to complement the still insufficient knowledge of methane ebullition fluxes from reservoirs with changing water levels.},

Moreover, as microbial food webs are typically long and primarily based upon regenerated phytoplankton production, microbial production contributes insignificantly to fish production in the oceans.

abstract = {The oxidative degradation of organic matter is a key process in the biogeochemical functioning of the earth system. Quantitative models of organic matter degradation are therefore essential for understanding the chemical state and evolution of the Earth's near-surface environment, and to forecast the biogeochemical consequences of ongoing regional and global change. The complex nature of biologically produced organic matter represents a major obstacle to the development of such models, however. Here, we compare the energetics of the oxidative degradation of a large number of naturally occurring organic compounds. By relating the Gibbs energies of half reactions describing the complete mineralization of the compounds to their average nominal carbon oxidation state, it becomes possible to estimate the energetic potential of the compounds based on major element (C, H, N, O, P, S) ratios. The new energetic description of organic matter can be combined with bioenergetic theory to rationalize observed patterns in the decomposition of natural organic matter. For example, the persistence of cell membrane derived compounds and complex organics in anoxic settings is consistent with their limited catabolic potential under these environmental conditions. The proposed approach opens the way to include the thermodynamic properties of organic compounds in kinetic models of organic matter degradation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Damming has exerted far-reaching and profound impacts on ecological functions in river ecosystems. However, the "damming effects" on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from tributaries of reservoirs in subtropical region were largely overlooked. In this study, we assessed the GHG fluxes (CH4, CO2and N2O) from air-water interface and the related factors in Xiangxi River of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region over one year. The annual average fluxes of CH4, CO2and N2O from Xiangxi River were 0.13±0.11mgm-2h-1, 16.01±23.21mgm-2h-1and 21.57±12.75$\mu$gm-2h-1, respectively, which were significantly lower than those from tropical rivers or lakes. The GHG fluxes showed strong seasonal dynamics: CH4was consistently released to the atmosphere and was more in summer than the other seasons. CO2was absorbed from the atmosphere in spring, but was emitted the most in winter. N2O flux was higher in cold season than in warm season. Additionally, CH4emission showed obvious spatial variations that decreased gradually from shallow to deep water-level areas. Correlation analysis demonstrated that CH4emission was negatively correlated with water depth and air-water temperature difference, and positively with air temperature. CO2flux was negatively related to chlorophyll a (Chl. a) and N2O flux was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO). The present study will deepen our understanding of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) construction impacts on GHG emissions in the tributaries, and help us to better estimate GHG emissions for TGR.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to carry out analysis of Maximum Likelihood (ML) classification on multispectral data by means of qualitative and quantitative approaches. ML is a supervised classification method which is based on the Bayes theorem. It makes use of a discriminant function to assign pixel to the class with the highest likelihood. Class mean vector and covariance matrix are the key inputs to the function and can be estimated from the training pixels of a particular class. In this study, we used ML to classify a diverse tropical land covers recorded from Landsat 5 TM satellite. The classification is carefully examined using visual analysis, classification accuracy, band correlation and decision boundary. The results show that the separation between mean of the classes in the decision space is to be the main factor that leads to the high classification accuracy of ML.},

abstract = {Methane bubble formation and transport is an important component of biogeochemical carbon cycling in aquatic sediments. To improve understanding of how sediment mechanical properties influence bubble growth and transport in freshwater sediments, a 20-day laboratory incubation experiment using homogenized natural clay and sand was performed. Methane bubble development at high resolution was characterized by $\mu$CT. Initially, capillary invasion by microbubbles ({\textless}0.1 mm) dominated bubble formation, with continued gas production (4 days for clay; 8 days for sand), large bubbles formed by deforming the surrounding sediment, leading to enhanced of macropore connectivity in both sediments. Growth of large bubbles ({\textgreater}1 mm) was possible in low shear yield strength sediments ({\textless}100 Pa), where excess gas pressure was sufficient to displace the sediment. Lower within the sand, higher shear yield strength ({\textgreater}360 Pa) resulted in a predominance of microbubbles where the required capillary entry pressure was low. Enhanced bubble migration, triggered by a controlled reduction in hydrostatic head, was observed throughout the clay column, while in sand mobile bubbles were restricted to the upper 6 cm. The observed macropore network was the dominant path for bubble movement and release in both sediments.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere from running waters are estimated to be four times greater than the total carbon (C) flux to the oceans. However, these fluxes remain poorly constrained because of substantial spatial and temporal variability in dissolved CO2 concentrations. Using a global compilation of high-frequency CO2 measurements, we demonstrate that nocturnal CO2 emissions are on average 27{\%} (0.9 gC m−2 d−1) greater than those estimated from diurnal concentrations alone. Constraints on light availability due to canopy shading or water colour are the principal controls on observed diel (24 hour) variation, suggesting this nocturnal increase arises from daytime fixation of CO2 by photosynthesis. Because current global estimates of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from running waters (0.65–1.8 PgC yr−1) rely primarily on discrete measurements of dissolved CO2 obtained during the day, they substantially underestimate the magnitude of this flux. Accounting for night-time CO2 emissions may elevate global estimates from running waters to the atmosphere by 0.20–0.55 PgC yr−1.},

abstract = {Constraints on hypolimnetic methane production in productive lakes are of interest owing to the importance of methane emissions from lakes for the atmospheric methane burden. We studied carbon fluxes and terminal electron accepting processes in the hypolimnion of eutrophic Meerfelder Maar, Germany. Carbon fluxes from epilimnion and sediments were estimated using sediment traps, porewater analysis and incubation techniques. The contribution of various redox processes to overall dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production was quantified from a seasonal hypolimnetic mass balance. Carbon sedimentation rates were 22 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from the epilimnion and 20-34 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from the hypolimnion. Anaerobic respiration accounted for a DIC production of 21 mmol m(-2) d(-1), and was thus capable of using a substantial part of primary production. The diffusive C flux from the sediment was small in comparison, although potential respiration rates in incubation experiments reached 63 - 75 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Ebullition of methane occurred, but could not be quantified. Following depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate, iron and sulphate reduction and methanogenesis proceeded concurrently in the hypolimnion. Estimated hypolimnetic DIC production decreased in the order methanogenesis (2267 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} oxic respiration (880 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} sulphate reduction (575mmolm(-2)) {\textgreater} denitrification (159 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} acetogenesis (157 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} iron reduction (19 - 144 mmol m(-2)). Methane production thus dominated respiration and was not inhibited by sulphate and iron reduction. It also strongly accelerated with increased carbon sedimentation rates in September, which apparently eased limiting factors on the process. Hypolimnetic methane production is thus likely an important process in similar lakes, even in the presence of other electron acceptors, and will contribute to methane emissions during fall turnover.},

abstract = {Organic acid dissociation has usually been estimated from the difference between measured cations and anions (the anion deficit approach). An alternative is to use alkalinity titrations and an estimate of strong organic acids from TOC as an independent measure of organic acid dissociation (the CBALK approach). This approach may reduce the potential for errors relative to the anion deficit approach, which relies on summing up all measured constituents. Organic acid dissociation in a set of Swedish surface water samples from 700 different lakes, as well as 200 samples from 11 streams was predicted using a triprotic analogue model with buffering characteristics similar to those of the widely used 'Oliver' model (OTM), but with a lower site density of organic acids. The average equilibrium pH of the samples in the weakly buffered pH range of 4.7-6.7 could be predicted more precisely (±0.16 pH units) using the CBALK approach, than when using the usual anion deficit approach (±0.41 pH units). The study supports the general applicability of models similar to the empirical OTM for predicting the dissociation of natural organic acids on a regional scale. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {1. Two pH electrodes and a thermistor were used to record conditions in the surface of Esthwaite Water every 15 min over a 12-month period. Combined with approximately weekly measurements of alkalinity they allowed inorganic carbon speciation to be calculated. 2. Large changes in pH from 7.1 to nearly 10.3, and hence in concentrations of inorganic carbon species, were measured over a year. Carbon speciation and pH varied on a diel, episodic and seasonal basis. Diel variation of up to pH 1.8 was recorded, although typical daily variation was between 0.03 and 1.06 (5 and 95 percentiles). Daily change in concentration of inorganic carbon varied between 4 and 63 mmol m-3 (5 and 95 percentiles). 3. During lake stratification, episodes of high pH, typically of 1-2 weeks' duration were interspersed with episodes of lower pH. These changes appeared to relate to the weather: e.g. low wind velocity, high pressure, low rainfall and high sunshine hours correlated with periods of high pH. 4. Seasonal progression of carbon depletion generally followed stratification and the development of high phytoplankton biomass. When the lake was isothermal, the phytoplankton biomass caused relatively small amounts of carbon depletion. 5. During autumn, winter and spring, the lake had concentrations of CO2* (free CO2) up to 0.12 mol m-3 which is nearly seven times the calculated atmospheric equilibrium concentration so the lake will accordingly be losing carbon to the atmosphere. In contrast, during periods of elevated pH the concentration of CO2* was reduced close to zero and the lake will take up atmospheric CO2. The rates of transfer between water and the atmosphere were estimated using a chemical equilibrium model with three boundary layer thicknesses. The calculations show that over a year the lake loses CO2 to the atmosphere with the current mean atmospheric level of 360 $\mu$mol mol-1, at between 0.28 and 2.80 mol m-2 yr-1. During elevated pH, rates of CO2-influx increased up to nearly tenfold as a result of chemical-enhancement by parallel flux of HCO3/-. Input of CO2* to the lake from the catchment is suggested to be the main source of the carbon lost to the atmosphere. 6. The turnover time for CO2 between the air and water was calculated to be 1 year for the gross influx and 3.3 years for the net flux. These values are less than the average water residence time of 0.25 years, which indicates that over a year inflow from streams is a more important source of inorganic carbon than the atmosphere. 7. Influx of CO2 from the atmosphere was calculated to be roughly equivalent to between 1 and 4{\%} of the rates of production in the water during mid-summer indicating that this source of inorganic carbon is not a major one in this lake. 8. Influx of CO2 from the hypolimnion was estimated on one occasion to be 6.9 10-9 mol m 2 s-1 i using transfer values based on mass eddy-diffusion. These rates are equivalent to 23{\%} of the rate of influx of CO2 from the atmosphere on this occasion which suggests that the hypolimnion is probably a small source of inorganic carbon to the epilimnion. The exception appears to be during windy episodes when pH is depressed. Calculations based on depth-profiles of CO2* and HCO3/- suggest that the measured changes in pH can be accounted for by entrainment of hypolimnetic water into the epilimniun. 9. The solubility product for calcite was exceeded by up to about sixfold which, although insufficient to allow homogeneous precipitation, may have allowed heterogeneous precipitation around algal particles.},

Climatological and monthly averages showed the presence of more productive waters in the inner shelf of the basin, especially during spring and fall, according to the phytoplankton blooms observed. This pattern was further confirmed by the modes obtained with an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) decomposition of weekly chlorophyll composite images performed for the whole period. The first EOF mode explained 20{\%} of the variability and corresponded to the chlorophyll seasonality in the basin. The second EOF mode accounted for 10{\%} of the variability and distinguished several regions with different oceanographic features in the area. Five zones could be identified among which, a coastal zone between Huelva and Cadiz, was found to show the highest chlorophyll concentration values. Local zonal winds, categorized as westerlies and easterlies, were coupled with differences in biological production. The former induced an increase in chlorophyll concentration whereas the latter caused a decrease in phytoplankton biomass. Rainfall and river discharge also affected markedly the chlorophyll concentration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Changes in the budget of dissolved methane measured in a small temperate lake over 1 year indicate that anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion and the autumn overturn period represent key factors for the overall annual methane emissions from lakes. During periods of stable stratification, large amounts of methane accumulate in anoxic deep waters. Approximately 46{\%} of the stored methane was emitted during the autumn overturn, contributing ∼80{\%} of the annual diffusive methane emissions to the atmosphere. After the overturn period, the entire water column was oxic, and only 1{\%} of the original quantity of methane remained in the water column. Current estimates of global methane emissions assume that all of the stored methane is released, whereas several studies of individual lakes have suggested that a major fraction of the stored methane is oxidized during overturns. Our results provide evidence that not all of the stored methane is released to the atmosphere during the overturn period. However, the fraction of stored methane emitted to the atmosphere during overturn may be substantially larger and the fraction of stored methane oxidized may be smaller than in the previous studies suggesting high oxidation losses of methane. The development or change in the vertical extent and duration of the anoxic hypolimnion, which can represent the main source of annual methane emissions from small lakes, may be an important aspect to consider for impact assessments of climate warming on the methane emissions from lakes. ■ INTRODUCTION Lakes are an important component of the global carbon cycle because they store and release substantial amounts of carbon dioxide 1,2 and are a particularly important source of methane in the global methane budget. 3−5 According to Bastviken et al., 6 most of the methane originating from lakes occurs in small lakes ({\textless}10 km 2), which release more methane per unit area than large lakes. 3,7 Although recent estimates of the lake size distribution suggest that the area of small lakes is only ∼26{\%} of the total global lake area, 8 methane emissions from small lakes still contribute a major fraction of global methane emissions from lakes. Estimates of global methane emissions from lakes typically distinguish between three pathways of methane release from the water body to the atmosphere: diffusive fluxes, ebullition, and release of stored methane. 6 Additionally, plant-mediated fluxes may also be an important pathway of methane emissions from lakes. 9,10 In lakes, methane is a major product of carbon cycling, 11 and most of the methane is produced within the sediments. A large proportion of this methane is removed by aerobic oxidation at oxic sediment−water interfaces or oxyclines within the water column 12 or by anaerobic oxidation. 13 Some of the methane is stored in the water column. In lakes with an anoxic hypolimnion, large amounts of dissolved methane can accumulate, which leads to a particularly large quantity of stored methane. 3,14−16 In monomictic and dimictic lakes, methane stored in anoxic hypolimnia can be released during periods of rapid vertical mixing (overturns) that occur once or twice a year, respectively. During overturn periods, the accumulated dissolved methane is redistributed over the entire water column, which can result in high diffusive methane fluxes to the atmosphere. 15,17,18 According to Bastviken et al., 3 the contribution of the stored methane to the overall annual methane emissions (the "storage flux") increases with decreasing lake size and reaches approximately 45{\%} in small lakes. However, this estimate assumes that all of the stored methane is released to the atmosphere. Conversely, several other studies 15,18,19 have claimed that most of the stored methane is oxidized in the water column during the overturn period. This suggests that a major contribution to the estimate of annual methane emissions from small lakes may have been substantially overestimated. Most of the studies that have investigated fluxes of stored methane have focused on the autumn overturn and its contribution to the overall annual methane emissions. 3 Recently, additional studies have investigated methane emissions during the spring overturn or spring and autumn},

abstract = {The study of the distribution of biomass by size provides an ataxonomic approach for analyzing the structure of the pelagic ecosystem. However, empirical data regarding planktonic size-structure in offshore areas are scarce. Here, we report the results of a study of the planktonic biomass size-distribution at several stations located within two regions (Sargasso Sea and New England Seamounts Area) of the Northwest Atlantic. The biomass size-spectra covered a body-size range from bacteria to mesozooplankton and a depth range from the surface to 400 m. It is shown that the slope of the normalized biomass size-spectrum (NBS-spectrum) varies depending on whether volume or carbon units are used. The transformation from volume to carbon units makes the slope of the NBS-spectrum approximately 0.15 units more negative. The distribution of normalized-biomass by size was linear (plotted on a log–log scale) at all stations. The slopes of the NBS-spectra (volume scale) ranged from −0.96 to −1.01. There were no significant differences among the slopes of the NBS-spectra within either of the two areas studied. In addition, no significant differences were detected between the stations in the Sargasso Sea and those located in the New England Seamounts area. Apart from a tendency towards a decrease in the intercept of the normalized-biomass axis of the size-spectra in deeper waters, the NBS-spectra were also very similar through depth. The slopes of the NBS-spectra in biovolume units are not significantly different from −1.0 (p{\textless}0.01), and therefore are in agreement with Sheldon's Linear Biomass Hypothesis. By contrast, the slopes of the NBS-spectra in carbon units are significantly different (p{\textless}0.01) from −1.0 (range=–1.09 to –1.17; all stations together=–1.14) and their numerical values are in close agreement with Platt and Denman's model and with the findings of Rodr{\'{i}}guez and Mullin, 1986a) for the North Pacific Central Gyre. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the planktonic size-structure of offshore oligotrophic systems is a conservative property.},

abstract = {Large continental reservoirs are important sinks of terrestrially-derived carbon (C), yet exhibit high inter-annual variability in net CO2 exchange with the atmosphere due to incompletely understood interactions between supply of solutes (C, nutrients, pH) and lake metabolism. Here we quantified the interaction between hydrology, aquatic metabolism and atmospheric CO2 exchange in the lacustrine Qu'Appelle arm of Lake Diefenbaker, Canada, by comparing total phytoplankton abundance (as Chlorophyll a), net primary productivity (NPP), ratios of microbial productivity (P) to respiration (R), and chemically-enhanced CO2 flux over four springs and summers (2010-2013) with contrasting hydrologic characteristics. Overall, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were correlated inversely (R2adj = 0.63, p {\textless} 0.0001) with $\delta$18O values of DO indicating a strong metabolic coupling in this polymictic basin, whereas correlations between concentration and C isotope ratios of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were not significant (R2adj {\textless} 0.05). In most years, P:R modeled from DO characteristics was {\textgreater}1, the basin was slightly autotrophic and CO2 was captured from the atmosphere. In contrast, the Qu'Appelle arm was a substantial source of CO2 during 2012 when river discharge was low, pH was {\textless}8.6, cyanobacteria were common, and P:R was {\textless}1. Multiple least-squares regressions and principal component analysis inferred that hydrologic variability influenced changes in water-column metabolism, whereas independent variation in pH was the main control of atmospheric CO2 exchange (R2adj CO2-pH = 0.84, p {\textless} 0.0001). Together, these findings suggest that lacustrine basins of alkaline reservoirs may lack strong coupling of water-column metabolism and CO2 dynamics on seasonal and inter-annual scales.},

abstract = {Water-level fluctuations due to reservoir management could substantially affect the timing and magnitude of reservoir methane (CH4) fluxes to the atmosphere. However, effects of such fluctuations on CH4 emissions have received limited attention. Here we examine CH4 emission dynamics in six Pacific Northwest U.S. reservoirs of varying trophic status, morphometry, and management regimes. In these systems, we show that water-level drawdowns can, at least temporarily, greatly increase per-area reservoir CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, and can account for more than 90{\%} of annual reservoir CH4 flux in a period of just a few weeks. Reservoirs with higher epilimnetic [chlorophyll a] experienced larger increases in CH4 emission in response to drawdown (R2 = 0.84, p {\textless} 0.01), suggesting that eutrophication magnifies the effect of drawdown on CH4 emission. We show that drawdowns as small as 0.5 m can stimulate ebullition events. Given that drawdown events of this magnitude are quite common in reservoirs, our results suggest that this process must be considered in sampling strategies designed to characterize total CH4 fluxes from reservoirs. The extent to which (and the mechanisms by which) drawdowns short-circuit connections between methanogenesis and methanotrophy, thereby increasing net CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, should be a focus of future work.

abstract = {There are still significant uncertainties in the magnitude and direction of carbon fluxes through coastal ecosystems. An important component of these biogeochemical budgets is ecosystem metabolism, the net result of organismal metabolic processes within an ecosystem. In this paper, I present a synthesis of published ecosystem metabolism studies from coastal ecosystems and describe an empirical observation that size-dependent patterns in aquatic gross primary production and community respiration exist across a wide range of coastal geomorphologies. Ecosystem metabolism scales to the 3/4 power with volume in deeper estuaries dominated by pelagic primary production and nearly linearly with area in shallow estuaries dominated by benthic primary production. These results can be explained by applying scaling arguments for efficient, directed transport networks developed to explain similar size-dependent patterns in organismal metabolism. The main conclusion from this synthesis is that the residence time of new, nutrient-rich water is a fundamental organizing principle for the observed patterns. Residence time changes allometrically with size in pelagic ecosystems because velocities change by only an order of magnitude across systems that span more than ten orders of magnitude in size. This nonisometric change in velocity with size requires lower specific metabolic rates at larger ecosystem sizes. This change in transport may also explain a shift from predominantly net heterotrophy to net autotrophy with increasing size. The scaling results are applied to the total estuarine area in the continental United States to estimate the contribution of estuarine systems to the overall coastal budget of organic carbon.},

abstract = {Dissimilatory Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction has an important influence on the geochemistry of modern environments, and Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms, most notably those in the Geobacteraceae family, can play an important role in the bioremediation of subsurface environments contaminated with organic or metal contaminants. Microorganisms with the capacity to conserve energy from Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction are phylogenetically dispersed throughout the Bacteria and Archaea. The ability to oxidize hydrogen with the reduction of Fe(III) is a highly conserved characteristic of hyperthermophilic microorganisms and one Fe(III)-reducing Archaea grows at the highest temperature yet recorded for any organism. Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-reducing microorganisms have the ability to oxidize a wide variety of organic compounds, often completely to carbon dioxide. Typical alternative electron acceptors for Fe(III) reducers include oxygen, nitrate, U(VI) and electrodes. Unlike other commonly considered electron acceptors, Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides, the most prevalent form of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) in most environments, are insoluble. Thus, Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-reducing microorganisms face the dilemma of how to transfer electrons derived from central metabolism onto an insoluble, extracellular electron acceptor. Although microbiological and geochemical evidence suggests that Fe(III) reduction may have been the first form of microbial respiration, the capacity for Fe(III) reduction appears to have evolved several times as phylogenetically distinct Fe(III) reducers have different mechanisms for Fe(III) reduction. Geobacter species, which are representative of the family of Fe(III) reducers that predominate in a wide diversity of sedimentary environments, require direct contact with Fe(III) oxides in order to reduce them. In contrast, Shewanella and Geothrix species produce chelators that solubilize Fe(III) and release electron-shuttling compounds that transfer electrons from the cell surface to the surface of Fe(III) oxides not in direct contact with the cells. Electron transfer from the inner membrane to the outer membrane in Geobacter and Shewanella species appears to involve an electron transport chain of inner-membrane, periplasmic, and outer-membrane c-type cytochromes, but the cytochromes involved in these processes in the two organisms are different. In addition, Geobacter species specifically express flagella and pili during growth on Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides and are chemotactic to Fe(II) and Mn(II), which may lead Geobacter species to the oxides under anoxic conditions. The physiological characteristics of Geobacter species appear to explain why they have consistently been found to be the predominant Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-reducing microorganisms in a variety of sedimentary environments. In comparison with other respiratory processes, the study of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction is in its infancy, but genome-enabled approaches are rapidly advancing our understanding of this environmentally significant physiology.},

abstract = {Water, salt and heat balance studies are surveyed and summarized within the context of coastal lagoons. The most important geomorphological factors influencing these physical processes are inlet configuration and dimensions, lagoon size and orientation with respect to prevailing winds, and water depth. Results of past water balance studies show that advective transport dominates gains and losses by rainfall, evaporation, surface runoff and groundwater seepage. All terms, however, show a distinct seasonality in response to seasonally changing winds, wet and dry periods and higher evaporative losses during summer months. Current measurements are decomposed into steady and non-steady components to show that in coastal lagoons the time varying, low frequency fluctuations are often dominant. When lagoon-shelf exchanges are restricted, tidal currents are often important only in the vicinity of inlets, and advection is primarily in response to local wind forcing. The wind driven circulation includes a downwind drift that produces a surface slope and drives a near-bottom return flow. A density driven current can be significant even in well mixed lagoons. Residual tidal flow can be important in the long term, but over shorter time intervals the net flow in response to local wind forcing is usually dominant. Salt balance is discussed in terms of transport through a transverse cross section, and in terms of local gains and losses at a given location. Transport occurs by advection and diffusion. Long term balances maintain brackish conditions in the lagoon; short term imbalances can change the salinity distribution significantly. Results from previous studies in lagoons and well mixed estuaries indicate that salt transport is primarily in response to advection associated with freshwater outflow or the slow draining and filling forced by changes in coastal sea level, tidal diffusion, and to shear effects arising from spatial correlations of vertical and especially transverse deviations in salinity and current speed. Heat balance, like water balance, is a response to local processes and advection. Heat energy gains and losses occur primarily over annual and diurnal periodicities, and over time scales on the order of 1-2 weeks in response to synoptic scale weather patterns. Previous studies indicate that heating is dominated by incoming solar radiation; cooling is primarily in response to outgoing long-wave radiation and latent heat fluxes. Advective heat fluxes are especially difficult to quantify because of strong spatial gradients in both temperature and velocity. Advection is of particular importance in the vicinity of inlets, because of lagoon-shelf differences in the rates of warming and cooling.},

Most research on this topic relies on data collected in natural low-alkalinity lakes, and it therefore remains unclear what role human-made calcareous lakes play in the current paradigm. In this study, we reported inorganic carbon fluxes and net ecosystem production in a calcareous human-made reservoir in Spain using mass balances of inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen. The inorganic carbon loadings reported are among the largest found in the literature, and the inorganic carbon pool in the reservoir depends on the net hydrological balance. The reservoir was identified as a net emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) and showed persistent net heterotrophy, although we could not find any clear dependence of CO2 emissions on the metabolic balance. The variability of inorganic carbon and the net ecosystem production were poorly correlated, suggesting that additional internal processes govern the transformation of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the water column. Considering the significant decrease in surface alkalinity occurring during the summer, carbonate precipitation may be the dominant process confounding the relationship between metabolism and inorganic carbon variability. These results indicate that the CO2 dynamics may be weakly coupled to net metabolism in calcareous systems and that net heterotrophy may occur simultaneously with eutrophic conditions and low dissolved organic carbon concentration in flushed systems such as reservoirs.

abstract = {Shallow fresh water bodies in peat areas are important contributors to greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere. In this study we determined the magnitude of CH4 and CO2 fluxes from 12 water bodies in Dutch wetlands during the summer season and studied the factors that might regulate emissions of CH4 and CO2 from these lakes and ditches. The lakes and ditches acted as CO2 and CH4 sources of emissions to the atmosphere; the fluxes from the ditches were significantly larger than the fluxes from the lakes. The mean greenhouse gas flux from ditches and lakes amounted to 129.1 ± 8.2 (mean ± SE) and 61.5 ± 7.1 mg m-2 h-1 for CO2 and 33.7 ± 9.3 and 3.9 ± 1.6 mg m-2 h-1 for CH4, respectively. In most water bodies CH4 was the dominant greenhouse gas in terms of warming potential. Trophic status of the water and the sediment was an important factor regulating emissions. By using multiple linear regression 87{\%} of the variation in CH4 could be explained by PO43- concentration in the sediment and Fe2+ concentration in the water, and 89{\%} of the CO2 flux could be explained by depth, EC and pH of the water. Decreasing the nutrient loads and input of organic substrates to ditches and lakes by for example reducing application of fertilizers and manure within the catchments and decreasing upward seepage of nutrient rich water from the surrounding area will likely reduce summer emissions of CO2 and CH4 from these water bodies. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Autonomous in situ sensors are needed to document the effects of today's rapid ocean uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (e.g., ocean acidification). General environmental conditions (e.g., biofouling, turbidity) and carbon-specific conditions (e.g., wide diel variations) present significant challenges to acquiring long-term measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with satisfactory accuracy and resolution. SEAS-DIC is a new in situ instrument designed to provide calibrated, high-frequency, long-term measurements of DIC in marine and fresh waters. Sample water is first acidified to convert all DIC to carbon dioxide (CO2). The sample and a known reagent solution are then equilibrated across a gas-permeable membrane. Spectrophotometric measurement of reagent pH can thereby determine the sample DIC over a wide dynamic range, with inherent calibration provided by the pH indicator's molecular characteristics. Field trials indicate that SEAS-DIC performs well in biofouling and turbid waters, with a DIC accuracy and precision of ∼2 $\mu$mol kg-1 and a measurement rate of approximately once per minute. The acidic reagent protects the sensor cell from biofouling, and the gas-permeable membrane excludes particulates from the optical path. This instrument, the first spectrophotometric system capable of automated in situ DIC measurements, positions DIC to become a key parameter for in situ CO 2-system characterizations. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Recent studies reported comparatively lower heterotrophic bacteria (HB) abundances in tropical regions, indicating that factors involved in bacterial losses could be more relevant in the tropics. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) are considered the main predators of HB in aquatic ecosystems, and one should expect higher abundances in the tropics because of differences in the food web configuration (absence of large daphnids). However, there are no comprehensive studies comparing HB and HNF abundances in a latitudinal gradient. We hypothesized that HB abundance would be lower in the tropics because HNF abundance would be higher, resulting in a tighter HNF-HB coupling. To test this hypothesis, we compiled a large dataset of HB and HNF abundances from tropical and temperate freshwater environments. We found that both HB and HNF abundances were lower in the tropical region, and that HNF-HB coupling does not differ between temperate and tropical regions. The lower HNF abundance and lack of coupling may be explained by a strong top-down control on HNF and/or their herbivory preference. Besides, no relationship was found between bacterial specific growth rate and either chlorophyll-a and HB abundance, indicating that bacterial losses may have an important role in tropical freshwaters. Thus, we found that HNF is likely not the main controllers of HB abundance, and that grazing by ciliates and cladocerans, together with the physiological effects of higher temperatures, may explain the high bacterial loss rates in the tropics.},

abstract = {Freshwater blooms of phytoplankton affect public health and ecosystem services globally1,2. Harmful effects of such blooms occur when the intensity of a bloom is too high, or when toxin-producing phytoplankton species are present. Freshwater blooms result in economic losses of more than US{\$}4 billion annually in the United States alone, primarily from harm to aquatic food production, recreation and tourism, and drinking-water supplies3. Studies that document bloom conditions in lakes have either focused only on individual or regional subsets of lakes4–6, or have been limited by a lack of long-term observations7–9. Here we use three decades of high-resolution Landsat 5 satellite imagery to investigate long-term trends in intense summertime near-surface phytoplankton blooms for 71 large lakes globally. We find that peak summertime bloom intensity has increased in most (68 per cent) of the lakes studied, revealing a global exacerbation of bloom conditions. Lakes that have experienced a significant (P {\textless} 0.1) decrease in bloom intensity are rare (8 per cent). The reason behind the increase in phytoplankton bloom intensity remains unclear, however, as temporal trends do not track consistently with temperature, precipitation, fertilizer-use trends or other previously hypothesized drivers. We do find, however, that lakes with a decrease in bloom intensity warmed less compared to other lakes, suggesting that lake warming may already be counteracting management efforts to ameliorate eutrophication10,11. Our findings support calls for water quality management efforts to better account for the interactions between climate change and local hydrological conditions12,13.},

The Jinpen Reservoir is a large canyon-shaped reservoir located in Shaanxi Province with a strong thermal stratification, which resulted in an anaerobic condition in the hypolimnion. We used a hydrodynamic module based on MIKE 3 to simulate the thermal structure of the Jinpen Reservoir and study the relationship between the thermal regime, reservoir operation and climate change. Based on the daily hydrological and climatic data from 2004 to 2013, we made 13 hypothetical simulated conditions that included extreme change of inflow volume, water level, air temperature, radiation, inflow water temperature and selective withdrawal to explore the effect of different factors on the thermal regime. The results showed that the period of thermal stratification, water column stability and surface water temperature were influenced by these factors. With the increase of air temperature, the simulation results indicated a stronger thermal stratification and a higher surface water temperature, which could cause water safety problems. Deep withdrawal could decrease water column stability and prompt water column mixing early, which could be used by reservoir managers to optimize the reservoir operation.},

abstract = {Peatlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, amounting to approximately 455 Pg. Carbon builds up in these water-saturated environments owing to the presence of phenolic compounds-which inhibit microbial activity and therefore prevent the breakdown of organic matter. Anoxic conditions limit the activity of phenol oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of phenolic compounds. Droughts introduce oxygen into these systems, and the frequency of these events is rising. Here, we combine in vitro manipulations, mesocosm experiments and field observations to examine the impact of drought on peatland carbon loss. We show that drought stimulates bacterial growth and phenol oxidase activity, resulting in a reduction in the concentration of phenolic compounds in peat. This further stimulates microbial growth, causing the breakdown of organic matter and the release of carbon dioxide in a biogeochemical cascade. We further show that re-wetting the peat accelerates carbon losses to the atmosphere and receiving waters, owing to drought-induced increases in nutrient and labile carbon levels, which raise pH and stimulate anaerobic decomposition. We suggest that severe drought, and subsequent re-wetting, could destabilize peatland carbon stocks; understanding this process could aid understanding of interactions between peatlands and other environmental trends, and lead to the development of strategies for increasing carbon stocks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Typical brackish water coastal lagoons can export metals, in particular, those soluble under anoxic conditions, such as manganese (Mn) and arsenic (As), and those forming stable chloro-complexes, such as cadmium (Cd). Organic compounds resulting from partial degradation of organic matter under anoxic conditions, as well as organic substances released by phytoplankton, can also form complexes and eventually export certain metals to coastal waters. Water chemistry of most trace metals in coastal lagoons is highly dependent on biological processes occurring in the water column that effect pH, dissolved oxygen, and quantity and quality of dissolved organic substances. ?? 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

With an estimated yearly amount of 12–29.6 Tg CH4 for reservoirs (Deemer et al., Bioscience 66:949–964, 2016) and up to 71.6 Tg CH4 for lakes (Bastviken et al., Science 331:50–50, 2011), they represent up to 10{\%} of total methane emissions and hence have to be taken into account in global budgets. Freshwater systems are emitting more methane than oceans although only covering about 3{\%} of the earth surface since methanogenesis, the building process of methane, is the main organic matter degradation step compared to oceans where sulfate reduction is dominant. Reservoirs in comparison to lakes have two additional methane release mechanisms, which are loss from methane-rich hypolimnion waters at the turbine and then degassing in the river to which the turbined water has been released. A still poorly constrained mechanism occurring in both systems is ebullition, the transfer of methane bubbles directly through the water column towards the atmosphere. Whereas in the oceans, mainly archaea often in a consortium with bacteria oxidize the methane in the sediments or water column, in freshwater systems the oxidation process seems to be much more versatile in respect to electron acceptors (oxygen, nitrate, iron, and manganese) as well as to the microorganisms involved. We believe that in the future there will be more discoveries and surprises when investigating freshwater methane oxidation.},

abstract = {Although previous studies suggest that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from reservoir sediment exposed to the atmosphere during drought may be substantial, this process has not been rigorously quantified. Here we determined carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) emissions from sediment cores exposed to a drying and rewetting cycle. We found a strong temporal variation in GHG emissions with peaks when the sediment was drained (C emissions from permanently wet sediment and drained sediments were, respectively, 251 and 1646 mg m −2 d −1 for CO 2 and 0.8 and 547.4 mg m −2 d −1 for CH 4) and then again during rewetting (C emissions from permanently wet sediment and rewetted sediments were, respectively, 456 and 1725mg m −2 d −1 for CO 2 and 1.3 and 3.1 mg m −2 d −1 for CH 4). To gain insight into the importance of these emissions at a regional scale, we used Landsat satellite imagery to upscale our results to all Brazilian reservoirs. We found that during the extreme drought of 2014-2015, an additional 1299 km 2 of sediment was exposed, resulting in an estimated emission of 8.5 × 10 11 g of CO 2-eq during the first 15 d after the overlying water disappeared and in the first 33 d after rewetting, the same order of magnitude as the year-round GHG emissions of large (∼mean surface water area 454 km 2) Brazilian reservoirs, excluding the emissions from the draw-down zone. Our estimate, however, has high uncertainty, with actual emissions likely higher. We therefore argue that the effects of drought on reservoir GHG emissions merits further study, especially because climate models indicate an increase in the frequency of severe droughts in the future. We recommend incorporation of emissions during drying and rewetting into GHG budgets of reservoirs to improve regional GHG emission estimates and to enable comparison between GHG emissions from hydroelectric and other electricity sources. We also emphasize that peak emissions at the onset of drought and the later rewetting should be quantified to obtain reliable emission estimates. ARTICLE HISTORY},

abstract = {The underwater light regime of a Mediterranean coastal lagoon (Albufera des Grau, Balearic Islands) was studied during four years in order to characterise the spatial and temporal variations in the light attenuation coefficient (K) and to assess the relative contribution of the different water components to total light attenuation. During the studied period K averaged 1.42 m-1 and ranged from 0.63 m-1 to 3.80 m-1. High temporal variability was observed in light attenuation coefficients, but the lagoon was spatially uniform. Percentage bottom irradiance in relation to specific requirements for the dominant macrophyte species (Ruppia cirrhosa) was used as an indicator of benthic light limitation. Macrophyte light limitation was expected to occur in the deepest areas of the lagoon during winter, the most turbid period of the annual cycle. During the macrophyte growing season, higher bottom irradiances were observed but a significant percentage of the lagoon benthos (17{\%} in spring and 7{\%} in summer) was expected to be light limited. In the deepest areas of the lagoon ({\textgreater}2 m) changes in bottom irradiance were related more to variations in the light attenuation coefficient than to variations in water level. However, water level appeared to play an important role in determining benthic light limitation at intermediate depths (1.5 m) for the range of K from 1.8 m-1 to 3.3 m-1. The partitioning of the light attenuation coefficient showed that phytoplankton was the main driver of the temporal dynamics of K, but only accounted for 44{\%} of total light attenuation on average. The mean contributions of the other water components to K were: DOC (47{\%}), tripton (6{\%}), and water (3{\%}). At low values of K, attenuation by DOC was responsible for up to 75{\%} of total attenuation. An equation to predict K from the concentration of water components explained 93{\%} of the variance. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: The importance of the south-west coast of Portugal as a spawning ground for the long-finned squid, Loligo vulgaris, was investigated between May 1993 and May 1994 at a site 3 Km East of Sagres. Hydrographic (tem-perature and salinity) observations were registered in situ and water samples were collected for laboratory determina-tions of chlorophyll a. Zooplankton was sampled with a 500 µm plankton net during 10mn trawls. Hydrographic and biological information was related to the occurrence of L. vulgaris egg masses at the site. The values of water temper-ature ranged from 13.0{\textordmasculine} C in January to 19.2{\textordmasculine} C in July, and the salinity varied between 35.3‰ in May of 1993 and 38.0 ‰, in November, December and March. The highest values for phytoplankton biomass were recorded in September and May, whereas the maximum zooplankton abundance was recorded between July and September. The most impor-tant zooplankton groups included cladocerans, copepods, crustacean larvae, fish eggs and appendicularians. We have concluded that the highest values for zooplankton abundance were recorded when the greater number of egg masses of L. vulgaris were observed.

There were important differences in the oceanographic conditions in these regions, with warmer, low-nutrient and low-chlorophyll waters in the Atlantic sector and colder, high-nutrient and high-chlorophyll waters in the Albor{\'{a}}n sector in which upwelling occurred. The biomass concentration of picoplanktonic cells was two times higher in the Atlantic area than in the richer Albor{\'{a}}n Sea waters. The average integrated abundance of picophytoplankton was negatively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration as well as with inorganic nitrogen availability. Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were the most abundant groups, and they showed a complementarity in their spatial distribution, with a shallower and more coastal distribution of Synechococcus and the presence of Prochlorococcus mainly at offshore stations and at deeper depths. The ratio of autotrophic picoplankton/total autotrophic biomass showed significant differences on both sides of the Strait, with much higher values in the Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz sector.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal distribution of physical, chemical and biological variables of the NE continental shelf of the Gulf of Cadiz were analyzed monthly during almost three annual cycles. This analysis was performed with the aim of deriving the main forcing factors controlling variability at inter-annual, seasonal and short-time scales. Meteorological forcing related to heavy episodes of rainfall that affected river discharges and the wind regime, controlled both the currents along the shelf together and the nutrient concentrations of the surface waters. Meteorological forcing in turn determined the subsequent development and maintenance of phytoplankton blooms. Superimposed on the seasonal cycle typical of temperate latitudes, the inputs of continental nutrients mainly from the Guadalquivir River, along with episodes of upwelling favored by the predominance of westerly winds triggered phytoplankton growth on the shelf, highlighting the markedly relevant role of this large estuary in the control of the biological activity on the shelf. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Understanding the hydrological process associated with Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) change is vital for decision-makers in improving human wellbeing. LU/LC change significantly affects the hydrology of the landscape, caused by anthropogenic activities. The scope of this study is to investigate the impact of LU/LC change on the hydrological process of Upper Baro Basin for the years 1987, 2002, and 2017. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used for the simulation of the streamflow. The required data for the SWAT model are soils obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization; Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and LU/LC were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The meteorological data such as Rainfall, Temperature, Sunshine, Humidity, and Wind Speeds were obtained from the Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency. Data on discharge were obtained from Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity. Ecosystems are deemed vital. Landsat images were used to classify the LU/LC pattern using ERDAS Imagine 2014 software and the LU/LC were classified using the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm of Supervised Classification. The Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) global sensitivity method within SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Procedures (SWAT-CUP) was used to identify the most sensitive streamflow parameters. The calibration was carried out using observed streamflow data from 01 January 1990 to 31 December 2002 and a validation period from 01 January 2003 to 31 December 2009. LU/LC analysis shows that there was a drastic decrease of grassland by 15.64{\%} and shrubland by 9.56{\%} while an increase of agricultural land and settlement by 18.01{\%} and 13.01{\%}, respectively, for 30 years. The evaluation of the SWAT model presented that the annual surface runoff increased by 43.53 mm, groundwater flow declined by 27.58 mm, and lateral flow declined by 5.63 mm. The model results showed that the streamflow characteristics changed due to the LU/LC change during the study periods 1987-2017 such as change of flood frequency, increased peak flows, base flow, soil erosion, and annual mean discharge. Curve number, an available water capacity of the soil layer, and soil evaporation composition factor were the most sensitive parameters identified for the streamflow. Both the calibration and validation results disclosed a good agreement between measured and simulated streamflow. The performance of the model statistical test shows the coefficient of determination (R2) and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency values 0.87 and 0.81 for calibration periods of 1990-2002 and 0.84 and 0.76 for the validation period of 2003 to 2009, respectively. Overall, LU/LC significantly affected the hydrological condition of the watershed. Therefore, different conservation strategies to maintain the stability and resilience of the ecosystem are vital.},

This dataset includes 1113 complete and homogeneous monthly precipitation time series from the Mediterranean Iberian Peninsula (IP), and corresponds to the five official Spanish hydrological divisions which drain into the Mediterranean Sea. The time series of annual and seasonal precipitation were used to test for trends. The absolute value of the anomaly time series was also tested for trends to identify changes in interannual variability of precipitation. The significance of these changes was assessed using the non-parametric Spearman rank test. The intensities of observed changes, both on mean values and variability, were estimated by using linear regression techniques. Finally, we analysed the area affected by different trends by using raster maps and spatial statistics, in addition to calculating the global balances for the five hydrological divisions. We detected high variability in precipitation regimes and conditions in the study area; nevertheless, a decrease in seasonal and annual precipitation has predominated in the east of the IP during the second half of the 20th century. On an annual scale, precipitation has diminished over 90.1{\%} of the study area. Additionally, a high percentage of the territory was affected by diminishing precipitation at a seasonal level: 85{\%} (of territory) in summer, 82{\%} in spring, 64{\%} during winter and 61{\%} in autumn. Taking the study area as a whole, seasonal precipitation decreases are ranked as follows: summer (-22.5{\%}), spring (-19.3{\%}), winter (-7.3{\%}), and autumn (-5.2{\%}), with a decrease in the value of the global mean annual precipitation -12.4{\%}. We also detected an increase of precipitation variability in winter (+23.5{\%}) and summer (+11.4{\%}), and a decrease in autumn and spring (-14.9 and -16.8{\%}, respectively) with a global mean value of +7.8{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2008 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Inland waters are significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. CO2 supersaturation and subsequent CO2 emissions from inland waters can be driven by internal metabolism, external inputs of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) derived from the catchment, and other processes (e.g., internal geochemical reactions of calcite precipitation or photochemical mineralization of organic solutes). However, the sensitivity of the magnitude and sources of CO2 emissions to fluvial network hydromorphological alterations is still poorly understood. Here we investigated both the magnitude and sources of CO2 emissions from lotic (i.e., running waters) and lentic (i.e., stagnant waters associated to small dams) waterbodies of a Mediterranean fluvial network by computing segment-scale mass balances of CO2. Our results showed that sources other than internal metabolism sustained most (82{\%}) of the CO2 emissions from the studied fluvial network. The magnitude and sources of CO2 emissions in lotic waterbodies were highly dependent on hydrology, with higher emissions dominated by DIC inputs derived from the catchment during high flows and lower emissions partially fueled by CO2 produced biologically within the river during low flows. In contrast, CO2 emissions in lentic waterbodies were low, relatively stable over the time and the space, and dominated by DIC inputs from the catchment regardless of the different hydrological situations. Overall, our results stress the sensitivity of fluvial networks to human activities and climate change and particularly highlight the role of hydromorphological conditions on modulating the magnitude and sources of CO2 emissions from fluvial networks.},

The resulting model suggested that, for the overall size range, the biovolume increased with individual body size by a factor of approximately 2 if the classical size ranges from pico, nano-, micro- and mesoplankton were considered Two antagonistic types of spectra were used to illustrate different configurations of the food web, the first with a volumetric autotroph-heterotroph ratio slightly higher than 1 (A:H = 1.02), the second largely dominated by heterotrophs (A:H = 0.02). The density spectra slope from the nano- to mesoplankton size range followed a seasonal trend, showing more negative values in late summer (September) and less negative values in winter Both the variability range of the slope and the seasonal trend were lessened when considering the picoplankton size range, suggesting that the microbial compartment plays a relevant role in the configuration of the food web in the lagoon.},

abstract = {Euphotic zone gross primary production, community respiration and net community production were determined from in vitro changes of dissolved oxygen, and from in vivo INT reduction capacity fractionated into two size classes, in offshore waters along a latitudinal transect crossing the North, Norwegian and Greenland Seas between the UK and Svalbard. Rates of gross primary production were higher and more variable than community respiration, so net autotrophy prevailed in the euphotic zone with an average net community production of 164??64mmol O2m-2d-1. Respiration seemed to be mainly attributed to large eukaryotic cells ({\textgreater}0.8??m) with smaller cells, mainly bacteria, accounting for a mean of 25{\%} (range 5-48{\%}) of community respiration. Estimates of bacterial growth efficiency were very variable (range 7-69{\%}) due to uncoupling between bacterial respiration and production. Larger cells tended to contribute more towards total respiration in communities with high gross primary production and low community respiration, while bacteria contributed more towards total respiration in communities with lower gross primary production, typical of microbial-dominated systems. This suggests that community respiration is related to the size structure of the plankton community. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Anaerobic methanotrophs help regulate Earth's climate and may have been an important part of the microbial ecosystem on the early Earth. The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is often thought of as a sulfate-dependent process, despite the fact that other electron acceptors are more energetically favorable. Here, we show that microorganisms from marine methane-seep sediment in the Eel River Basin in California are capable of using manganese (birnessite) and iron (ferrihydrite) to oxidize methane, revealing that marine AOM is coupled, either directly or indirectly, to a larger variety of oxidants than previously thought. Large amounts of manganese and iron are provided to oceans from rivers, indicating that manganese- and iron-dependent AOM have the potential to be globally important.},

abstract = {To establish a metabolic state along a north{\^{a}}€“south transect in Antarctic waters, we approached community respiration (CR) from a combined perspective based on the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) and the size-scaling of the whole planktonic community. A detailed analysis of a summer integrated multi-trophic normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS), from heterotrophic bacteria to zooplankton, was carried out. To acquire individual size data, different techniques were combined: flow cytometry for smaller fractions ({\textless}20 {\^{A}}µm of equivalent spherical diameter), FlowCAM for larger nano- and microplankton and scanning and image analysis for the zooplankton fractions. The distribution of the NBSS was linear at all stations (R2 values: 0.87{\^{a}}€“0.93) but dome-shape features appeared related to phytoplankton cell distribution which are responsible for a large fraction of microbial respiration. Generally, the region showed an autotrophic budget south of the archipelago due to gross primary production (GPP) values up to 2804 mg C m{\^{a}}ˆ'2 day{\^{a}}ˆ'1, where salps could significantly contribute to the carbon export flux. Contrastingly, higher CR rates ({\textgreater}1000 mg C m{\^{a}}ˆ'2 day{\^{a}}ˆ'1) were found at the northern stations due to a higher phytoplankton respiration activity associated with increasing sea water temperatures and a higher presence of heterotrophic organisms (microheterotrophs, chaetognaths and copepods) resulting in a net heterotrophic metabolic state (GPP/CR {\textless} 1).},

abstract = {Rates of sediment oxygen demand (SOD) were determined for hypereutrophic Onondaga Lake, New York (USA), by direct and indirect means. The direct approach, laboratory measurements made on intact sediment cores, yielded an average SOD rate of 1.68 ± 0.56 g O2 m-2 day-1. This was essentially equivalent to that determined indirectly by estimating the sediment flux of reduced chemical species (1.64 ± 0.14 g O2 m-2 day-1). The findings suggest that recovery of the oxygen resources of the lake will be mediated primarily through reductions in the delivery of particulate organic matter to be sediments and the rate at which in-place reserves of particulate organic matter are stabilized. The processes of algal respiration and aerobic mineralization of organic matter in the water column, which exhibit a more rapid response to remediation measures, will play a lesser role. -from Authors},

Even in a steady state ecosystem such as that analyzed here, there is variability in space and time; this suggests that one must be careful in extrapolating the relation to less predictable marine areas. In obtaining dynamic information from biomass spectra, one must distinguish changes due to the flow of energy within the spectrum (growth, predation, reproduction) from changes due to emi- gration from or immigration into the spectrum of the particular area sampled, such as those due to the diel vertical migration of macrozooplankton in the largest size classes.},

In seeking to identify the pathways in question, use was made of analysis of stable carbon isotopes in CH4 and CO2 dissolved in pore water. This determined that CH4 is mainly produced through acetate fermentation, though the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic process may also be of importance, especially in deeper layers of sediments. Both the presence of autochthonous organic matter and increased pH values are shown to favour acetate fermentation. In turn, methanogenesis in sediments is assessed as capable of accounting for the generation of a considerable amount of CO2. Indeed, the role of methanogenesis in CO2 production is increasingly important further down in the layers of sediment, where allochthonous organic matter is predominant.},

abstract = {Rapid increases in human population and land transformation in arid and semi-arid regions are altering water, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, yet little is known about how urban ephemeral stream channels in these regions affect biogeochemistry and trace gas fluxes. To address these knowledge gaps, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) before and after soil wetting in 16 ephemeral stream channels that vary in soil texture and organic matter in Tucson, AZ. Fluxes of CO2 and N2O immediately following wetting were among the highest ever published (up to 1,588 mg C m−2 h−1 and 3,121 $\mu$g N m−2 h−1). Mean post-wetting CO2 and N2O fluxes were significantly higher in the loam and sandy loam channels (286 and 194 mg C m−2 h−1; 168 and 187 $\mu$g N m−2 h−1) than in the sand channels (45 mg C m−2 h−1 and 7 $\mu$g N m−2 h−1). Factor analyses show that the effect of soil moisture, soil C and soil N on trace gas fluxes varied with soil texture. In the coarser sandy sites, trace gas fluxes were primarily controlled by soil moisture via physical displacement of soil gases and by organic soil C and N limitations on biotic processes. In the finer sandy loam sites trace gas fluxes and N-processing were primarily limited by soil moisture, soil organic C and soil N resources. In the loam sites, finer soil texture and higher soil organic C and N enhance soil moisture retention allowing for more biologically favorable antecedent conditions. Variable redox states appeared to develop in the finer textured soils resulting in wide ranging trace gas flux rates following wetting. These findings indicate that urban ephemeral channels are biogeochemical hotspots that can have a profound impact on urban C and N biogeochemical cycling pathways and subsequently alter the quality of localized water resources.},

abstract = {Upwelling events off the Southwest coast of Portugal can trigger phytoplankton blooms that are important for the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in this region. However, climate change scenarios forecast fluctuations in the intensity and frequency of upwelling events, thereby potentially impacting these sectors. Shifts in the phytoplankton community were analysed from the end of 2008 until the beginning of 2012 by examining the bio-optical properties of the water column, namely the absorption coefficients for phytoplankton, non-algal particles and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The phytoplankton community was assessed by microscopy, with counts from an inverted microscope, and by chemotaxonomic methodologies, using pigment concentrations determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Results both from microscopy and from chemotaxonomic methods showed a shift from diatom dominance related to bloom conditions matching upwelling events, to small flagellate dominance related to no-bloom conditions matching relaxation of upwelling. During bloom conditions, light absorption from phytoplankton increased markedly, while non-algal particles and CDOM absorption remained relatively constant. The dynamics of CDOM in the study area was attributed to coastal influences rather than from phytoplankton origin. Changes in phytoplankton biomass and consequent alterations in phytoplankton absorption coefficients were attributed to upwelling regimes in the area. Bio-optical parameters can contribute to environmental monitoring of coastal and oceanic waters, which in the case of the European Union, involves the implementation of the Water Framework, Marine Strategy Framework and Marine Spatial Planning Directives.},

Aracena and La Minilla reservoirs were studied since July 1973 and El Gergal reservoir since October 1979. The results allowed the examination of the different factors which control thc interannual variability of the trophic state of the reservoirs. Because of the high variability of average yearly rainfall, that is characteristic of the Mediterranean climate asea, the water renewal rate of the reservoirs varies greatly from year to year. This water renewal rate plays a more important role than nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) availability in controlling algal biomass and consequently, primary production. Nevertheless, its relative importance depends on the phosphorus loading of each reservoir. In the case of La Minilla reservoir, water renewal rate is the only factor significantly correlated with phytoplankton biomass.},

abstract = {Three major reservoirs (Marne, Seine and Aube), situated in the upstream basin of the river Seine represent a storage capacity of 800 106 m3. In order to quantify the possible role of these reservoirs as a sink or source of nutrients and organic matter for the river system, an input/output mass-balance of suspended matter, organic carbon, inorganic nitrogen forms, phosphorus and reactive silica was established, providing reliable estimates of their retention/elimination and export. The study was carried out over 3 years (1993, 1994 and 1995) in differing hydrological conditions. The retention times varied from 0.3 to 0.8 year, depending on the reservoir and the year, but was longer in 1993 that was a drier year than 1994 and 1995, hydrologically quite similar. Regarding retention (or elimination) and export, the behaviour of the three studied reservoirs was similar. A clear loss or retention of nitrogen, phosphorus and silica was observed in the reservoirs and represented about 40{\%} of the incoming flux of nitrate, 50{\%} of silica, and 60{\%} of phosphate. The retention was lower for total phosphorus than for phosphate. The reservoirs are also sites of suspended matter deposition except during the decennial drawdown, when suspended matter is exported. For inorganic nitrogen, the average amount of nitrate retained in the Seine basin reservoirs upstream from Paris is 5000 tonnes y-1 that is almost equal to the estimated retention by deposition or denitrification in river channel sediments for the whole drainage network. The retention in the reservoirs represents about 12{\%} of the total flux of nitrate at the outlet of the basin upstream from Paris, and 5{\%} at the mouth of the Seine River. We also calculated inlake C, N, P, Si budgets on the basis of direct process measurements. Measurements of planktonic primary and bacterial activity production led to annual net production of 4200 and 580 tonnes of carbon, respectively. A reasonable value (450 tonnes of carbon) of grazing was calculated. Corresponding N, P, Si fluxes were drawn from appropriate C:N:P:Si ratios. Benthic fluxes were measured with bell jars. The retention of P and Si represents a small fraction of important internal fluxes of phytoplanktonic uptake and recycling, while inorganic nitrogen retention depends mostly on benthic denitrification. The behaviour of P and Si differs in that P is mainly recycled in the water column, while Si dissolution occurs at the sediment interface. Nitrogen is recycled in both the planktonic and the benthic phase.},

The new era of dam building was begun in Iran in the mid 50s by international companies and has since remained the major approach to water supply. Yet dam building has affected the quantity and quality of water in watersheds, rivers and other water bodies, leading to noticeable destruction of natural habitats and species. Dam building has inundated forests in reservoirs, helped in timber smuggling upstream, and decreased forests downstream, thus accelerating desertification.

However, we experimentally and theoretically document that the presence of free gas in sediments can counteract this enhancement effect. The apparent diffusivities (Da) of Rhodamine WT and bromide in sediments containing 8-18{\%} gas (Da,YE) were suppressed by 7-39{\%} compared to the control (no gas) sediments (Da,C). The measured ratios of Da,YE:Da,C were well within the range of ratios predicted by a theoretical soil model for gas-bearing soils. Whereas gas voids in sediments reduce the Da for soluble species, they represent a shortcut for low-soluble species such as methane and oxygen. Therefore, the presence of even minor amounts of gas can increase the fluxes of low-soluble species (i.e., gases) by several factors, while simultaneously suppressing fluxes of dissolved species.

abstract = {Nitrification is an oxygen consumptive process, consuming 2mol of oxygen per mol of ammonium oxidized. Hypolimnion and sediment samples were collected during the summers of 2008-2010 in Lake Erie to determine the total oxygen consumption and oxygen consumption from nitrification by blocking nitrification with selective inhibitors. Oxygen consumption by nitrification in the hypolimnion was 3.7±2.9(mean±1 SD)$\mu$molO2/L/d, with nitrification accounting for 32.6±22.1{\%} of the total oxygen consumption. Nitrification in the hypolimnion contributed more to oxygen consumption in the eastern sites than western sites and was lowest in September. The nitrification rate did not correlate with environmental factors such as oxygen, nitrate or ammonium, or nitrifier numbers. Oxygen consumption by nitrification in sediment slurries was 7.1±5.8$\mu$molO2/g/d, with nitrification accounting for 27.0±19.2{\%} of the total oxygen consumption with the lowest rates in July and the lowest percentages in June. Oxygen consumption by nitrification in intact sediment cores was 682±61.1$\mu$molO2/m/d with nitrification accounting for 30.4±10.7{\%} of the total oxygen consumption. Nitrification rates in intact cores were generally highest in September. The proportion of oxygen consumed by nitrification corresponds closely with what would be predicted from complete oxidation of a Redfield molecule (23{\%}). While nitrification is unlikely to be the dominant oxygen consumptive process, the rates observed in Lake Erie were sufficient to theoretically deplete a large portion of the hypolimnetic oxygen pool during the stratified period. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research.},

abstract = {1. Transitional waters, described as critical transition zones because of their position at terrestrial, freshwater and marine interfaces, provide essential goods and services to the biosphere including human populations. These ecotones face increasing human influence mainly due to population density increase in coastal areas. 2. Transitional water bodies have, to date, received little attention in the development of ecological status indicators, this is a critical deficiency when trying to meet the Water Framework Directive objective of all significant water bodies achieving good ecological status by the year 2015. 3. In order to assess changes in transitional water communities many taxonomic-based indicators have already been proposed but there are a number of concerns for their use such as taxonomic classification difficulties, their unsuitability for multi-site comparisons and their inconsistent relationships with disturbance or stress. 4. Alternative methods based on body size, abundance distribution among functional groups, functional diversity and productivity descriptors are proposed. These methods offer the opportunity to compare sites with different taxonomic compositions and allow derivation of indicators related to ecological status of communities under scrutiny. 5. Finally, the suitability of these taxonomic-free descriptors to provide relevant information for each of the four main biotic compartments in coastal lagoons is discussed. The use of biomass distribution among functional groups for fish, benthos and macrophyte and to use body-size distribution for benthos and plankton is proposed.

abstract = {Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo), mainly carried out by n-damo bacteria, is an important pathway for mitigating methane emission from freshwater lakes. Although n-damo bacteria have been detected in a variety of freshwater lakes, their potential and distribution, and associated environmental factors, remain unclear. Therefore, the current study investigated the potential and distribution of anaerobic methanotrophs in sediments from Erhai Lake and Dianchi Lake, two adjacent freshwater lakes in the Yunnan Plateau with different trophic status. Both lakes showed active anaerobic methane oxidation potential and harbored a high density of n-damo bacteria. Based on the n-damo pmoA gene, sediment n-damo bacterial communities mainly consisted of Candidatus Methylomirabils oxyfera and Candidatus Methylomirabils sinica, as well as novel n-damo organisms. Sediment anaerobic methane oxidation potential and the n-damo bacterial community showed notable differences among seasons and between lakes. The environmental variables associated with lake trophic status (e.g. total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and total organic carbon) might have significant impacts on the anaerobic methane oxidation potential, as well as the abundance and community structure of n-damo bacteria. Therefore, trophic status could determine the n-damo process in freshwater lake sediment.},

abstract = {The alkalinity of water is widely used for the monitoring of natural water. The concentration of hydrogen carbonates [1, 2] is often calculated from this alkalinity index. However, this is incorrect because other salts of weak acids can contribute to the alkalinity of water. It would be more reliable to express the alkalinity of water in mg L-1 , thus indicating which equivalent amount of hydrogen carbonates corresponds to the given alkalinity, or, as is customary done in Ireland, in units of mg CaCO 3 L-1 [3]. The concentration of the other anions of weak acids is calculated from an ion balance of water; however, as the concentration of hydrogen carbonate differs from the true value, the concentration of the former ions will also be unreliable. Consequently, the classification of waters with respect to the predominant ions will not correspond with reality. This is of particular importance for natural humic water enriched in organic matter of allochthonous origin. The aim of this work was to determine the contribution of organic acid anions to the alkalinity of water and, based on this contribution, to refine procedures for calculating the concentration of hydrogen carbonate in natural humic water. EXPERIMENTAL The alkalinity of water (Alk) was determined by the two-point titration method (to pH 4.5 and 4.2) [4, 5] and calculated from the equation Alk = (2 V 4.5-V 4.2) N / V , where V 4.5 and V 4.2 are the volumes of a strong acid consumed for the titration of a sample to pH 4.5 and 4.2, respectively; V is the sample volume; and N is the normality of the acid solution. The amount of organic acid anions was calculated from the ion balance of water, [ ] = [ $\Sigma$ cat ]-[ ]-[ $\Sigma$ sa ], (1) HCO 3-A org-HCO 3-where $\Sigma$ cat is the sum of cations and $\Sigma$ sa is the sum of strong acid anions. The {\"{e}} ‡ 2+ and Mg 2+ ions were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry [6], Na + and K + were determined by flame photometry [7], and was determined by the indophenol method [8]. Sulfates and chlorides were determined by ion chromatography [9]. Nitrates were determined by reduction to nitrites on a Cu-Cd reductor [10], and pH was determined by potentiometry. All chemical analyses were performed in the Laboratory of Hydrochemistry and Hydrology of the Institute of Water Problems of the North of the Karelian Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences; this laboratory was accredited by the Gos-standart of Russia. The reliability of the chemical analyses of water was tested by internal and external controls. The latter was performed within the framework of an ICP-Waters international project [11]. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In the general case, the alkalinity of water is due to the presence of anions of weak acids (carbonic acid, organic acids, phosphoric acid, silicic acid, sulfurous acid, etc.) [12]. Silicates in natural water are fully hydrolyzed and occur as silicic acid in the studied pH regions; therefore, silicates do not contribute to the alkalinity. Phosphates occur in microgram amounts. The occurrence of sulfites is unlikely if oxygen is present in water. Therefore, the real alkalinity of water is due to the presence of the alkali and alkaline-earth metal salts of carbonic acid and organic acids, primarily, humic and fulvic acids. To find their contribution, let us consider the determination of alkalinity by the two-point titration of aqueous solutions of the salts of organic acids in the presence of alkali and alkaline-earth metal NH 4 + ARTICLES Abstract-It was found that the correction for organic acid anions to the alkalinity of water depends on the concentration of these anions, their dissociation constant, and pH; for humic water, it is expressed by the equation [ ∆ ] = [ ](0.094-9064 × 10-pH). Based on this equation and data on the alkalinity and ion balance of water, the concentrations of hydrogen carbonates and organic acid anions can be calculated. In accordance with the found average dissociation constant of humic acids ( K = 4.0), the contribution of their anions to the alkalinity of water is no higher than 10{\%} of their concentration.

abstract = {In this study we exploit recent advances in high-resolution autonomous monitoring to investigate the impact of short-term variations in wind-induced mixing on the surface biomass and vertical distribution of buoyant and sinking phytoplankton species. An autonomous platform (the Automatic Water Quality Monitoring Station) moored in a Mediterranean reservoir provided minute-by-minute records of wind speed and the phytoplankton fluorescence during winter and summer. This information was then used here to quantify the impact of short-term changes in the weather on the vertical distribution of diatoms and cyanobacteria. Additionally, we apply an empirical model to determine the extent of entrainment of diatoms and cyanobacteria within the turbulent upper layers of the water column. During winter, the surface time series of fluorescence was positively correlated with the short-term variations in wind speed. In contrast, during the summer, fluorescence was negatively correlated with wind speed. In the latter case, turbulence overcame the flotation velocity of buoyant cyanobacteria, thus homogenizing their vertical distribution and decreasing surface biomass. In both cases, the dynamic response of surface phytoplankton biomass to short-term changes in wind stress was rapid, within the minute scale. As far as we know from the literature, this is the first study in which the interaction between wind stress and surface phytoplankton fluorescence has been quantified on such a fine temporal scale. Finally, relevance for forecasting and reservoir management is pointed out. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This quantification must consider both temporal and spatial variability of reservoir carbon gas fluxes. In addition, it is relevant to reinforce re- search focusing on the emission of CO2 and CH4 in Mediterranean reservoirs. Here, we simultaneously measured CO2 fluxes and CH4 ebullitive and diffusive emissions in the riverine and lacustrine zones of a Mediterranean reservoir (El Gergal, Spain) throughout a complete year to quantify their magnitude, explore their spatial and temporal variability, and investigate the potential limnological and hydrological factors influencing gases emissions. Our results show that during the study year El Gergal riverine zone was a CO2 sink, while the lacustrine zone was a CO2 source. In addition, both areas were CH4 sources to the atmosphere. CO2 and CH4 fluxes in El Gergal showed a marked temporal variability, with significant differences between mixing and thermally stratified periods. CO2 emissions were significantly influenced by surface chlorophyll-a concentration and pH, suggesting the prevalent role of primary production as CO2 flux driver. CH4 emissions were influenced by hypolim- netic methane concentration and hydrological factors potentially affected by climate change, such as water renewal rate and water column depth.},

abstract = {Recent, parallel developments in the study of freshwater and marine ecosystems have provided evidence that net heterotrophic systems (those in which respiratory organic matter destruction exeeds photosynthetic production) are more prevalent than hitherto believed, including most rivers, oligo- to mesotrophic lakes and some oligotrophic regions of the ocean. In parallel, these aquatic ecosystems have been shown to act as CO2 sources to the atmosphere, as expected from the heterotrophic nature of the communities they contain. The prevalence of net heterotrophic aquatic ecosystems indicates that they must receive significant inputs of organic carbon from adjacent ecosystems, assigning an important role to the lateral exchanges of carbon between land and aquatic ecosystems, between coastal and open ocean ecosystems, as well as internal redistribution within large or complex aquatic ecosystems in determining their metabolic status and the gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. The examination of the carbon budget of ecosystems requires, therefore, an integrative approach that accounts for exchanges between compartments often studied in isolation. These recent findings conform a new paradigm of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and the metabolic connectivity between ecosystems in the biosphere.},

abstract = {Studies were carried out to elucidate the nature and importance of Fe reduction in anaerobic slurries of marine surface sediment. A constant accumulation of Fe took place immediately after the endogenous NO(3) was depleted. Pasteurized controls showed no activity of Fe reduction. Additions of 0.2 mM NO(3) and NO(2) to the active slurries arrested the Fe reduction, and the process was resumed only after a depletion of the added compounds. Extended, initial aeration of the sediment did not affect the capacity for reduction of NO(3) and Fe, but the treatments with NO(3) increased the capacity for Fe reduction. Addition of 20 mM MoO(4) completely inhibited the SO(4) reduction, but did not affect the reduction of Fe. The process of Fe reduction was most likely associated with the activity of facultative anaerobic, NO(3)-reducing bacteria. In surface sediment, the bulk of the Fe reduction may be microbial, and the process may be important for mineralization in situ if the availability of NO(3) is low.},

abstract = {Quantification and comparisons of the structure of open-water plankton communities from 25 inland lakes of Ontario, from the Laurentian Great Lakes Superior, Huron, St. Clair, Ontario, and Erie, and from the Central Gyre in the North Pacific Ocean were made on the basis of the normalized biomass size spectrum. Residual variation around the fitted straight lines (corresponding to a theoretical steady state) was least for the large, oligotrophic Lake Superior and the North Pacific Gyre and greatest for eutrophic Saginaw Bay and shallow Lake Erie, suggesting progressive departure from steady-state conditions with increasing system productivity. The slopes of the normalized spectra decrease with increasing eutrophy, indicating that nannoplankton abundances are similar in all communities studied, but that associated zooplankton abundances vary by 2.5 orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that parameterization of particle-size models for prediction of potential fish production must be adjusted according to the size and productivity of the ecosystem, and that routine monitoring of communities by the normalized biomass spectrum could providd early warning of nutrient or toxic stress in aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Soil respiration - Rs, the flux of CO2 from the soil to the atmosphere - is probably the least well constrained component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Here we introduce the SRDB database, a near-universal compendium of published Rs data, and make it available to the scientific community both as a traditional static archive and as a dynamic community database that may be updated over time by interested users. The database encompasses all published studies that report one of the following data measured in the field (not laboratory): annual Rs, mean seasonal Rs, a seasonal or annual partitioning of Rs into its sources fluxes, Rs temperature response (Q10), or R s at 10 °C. Its orientation is thus to seasonal and annual fluxes, not shorter-term or chamber-specific measurements. To date, data from 818 studies have been entered into the database, constituting 3379 records. The data span the measurement years 1961-2007 and are dominated by temperate, well-drained forests. We briefly examine some aspects of the SRDB data - its climate space coverage, mean annual Rs fluxes and their correlation with other carbon fluxes, Rs variability, temperature sensitivities, and the partitioning of Rs source flux - and suggest some potential lines of research that could be explored using these data. The SRDB database is available online in a permanent archive as well as via a project-hosting repository; the latter source leverages open-source software technologies to encourage wider participation in the database's future development. Ultimately, we hope that the updating of, and corrections to, the SRDB will become a shared project, managed by the users of these data in the scientific community. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {Eutrophication is a major threat to coastal ecosystems. Within Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) has established the need of developing methods of assessment. Bulk chlorophyll "a" is used world-wide as an indicator of eutrophication. However, the size structure of the phytoplankton communities has not been investigated, in detail, in relation to eutrophication pressures. This study investigates the suitability of fractionated chlorophyll "a" ({\textless}10 and {\textgreater}10 $\mu$m), as an indicator of eutrophication. Along the Basque coast (northern Spain) several water bodies, ranging from offshore waters to the heads of the estuaries, were surveyed during 2008. Physico-chemical conditions and chlorophyll "a" showed a distinct spatial gradient. Trophic richness increased towards the middle and inner parts of the estuaries, where nutrient inputs, from natural or anthropogenic sources, together with the residence time of the water are usually higher. In summer, phytoplankton biomass and abundance decreased, generally, in offshore and coastal waters; in estuaries, they tended to increase. The chlorophyll distribution within the two size fractions was coherent with the phytoplankton taxonomic composition. In summer, the relative abundance of small-sized cells (diatoms and non-siliceous taxa) increased. The relationships between size-fractionated chlorophyll and physico-chemical variables differed, when comparing the offshore and coastal waters, with the estuaries. In the offshore and coastal waters, a strong seasonality was observed; in estuaries, an important spatial component was found. Fractionated chlorophyll provided complementary useful information on anthropogenic pressures. However, more research is necessary to utilise this variable as a tool for ecological status assessment, within the WFD. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The influence of the size distribution of phytoplankton on changes in the planktonic food web structures with eutrophication was examined using natural planktonic communities in two world-famous lakes: Lake Baikal and Lake Biwa. The size distribution of phytoplankton and the ratio of heterotrophic to autotrophic biomass (H/A ratio), indicating the balance between primary production and its consumption, were investigated in the lakes of different trophic status. The results revealed that microphytoplankton ({\textgreater}20 mu m) in mesotrophic Lake Biwa, and picophytoplankton ({\textless}2 mu m) or nanophytoplankton (2-20 mu m) in oligotrophic Lake Baikal, comprised the highest proportion of the total phytoplankton biomass. The H/A ratio was lower in Lake Biwa ({\textless}1.) than in Lake Baikal ({\textgreater}1). The low H/A ratio in Lake Biwa appeared to be the consequence of the lack of consumption of the more abundant microphytoplankton, which were inferior competitors in nutrient uptake under oligotrophic conditions but less vulnerable to grazing. As a result, unconsumed microphytoplankton accumulated in the water column, decreasing the H/A ratio in Lake Biwa. Our results showed that food web structure and energy flow in planktonic communities were greatly influenced by the size distribution of phytoplankton, in conjunction with bottom-up (nutrient uptake) and top-down (grazing) effects at the trophic level of primary producers.},

abstract = {Hydroelectric reservoirs cover an area of 3.4× 105 km 2 and comprise about 20{\%} of all reservoirs. In addition, they contain large stores of formerly terrestrial organic carbon. Significant amounts of greenhouse gases are emitted, especially in the early years following reservoir creation, but the global extent of these emissions is poorly known. Previous estimates of emissions from all types of reservoir indicate that these human-made systems emit 321Tg of carbon per year (ref.). Here we assess the emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from hydroelectric reservoirs, on the basis of data from 85 globally distributed hydroelectric reservoirs that account for 20{\%} of the global area of these systems. We relate the emissions to reservoir age, location biome, morphometric features and chemical status. We estimate that hydroelectric reservoirs emit about 48TgC as CO 2 and 3TgC as CH 4, corresponding to 4{\%} of global carbon emissions from inland waters. Our estimates are smaller than previous estimates on the basis of more limited data. Carbon emissions are correlated to reservoir age and latitude, with the highest emission rates from the tropical Amazon region. We conclude that future emissions will be highly dependent on the geographic location of new hydroelectric reservoirs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {On the basis of correlative studies, picoplankton in Calder Lake, New York, are apparently unaffected by seasonal fluxes in nutrient (N and P) levels. In this small eutrophic lake, picoplankton ({\textless}2.0- to 0.2-mum size) and nanoplankton ({\textless}20 to {\textgreater}2 mum) predominate. Microplankton ({\textgreater}20 mum) are typically least important. Experiments were conducted in situ to test whether N, P or N/P ratios affect the predominance of these smaller organisms. Manipulations were run in 4-liter microcosms during June, July, and August 1988, corresponding to periods of increasing stratification and nutrient depletion. Following nutrient additions, phytoplankton were harvested and fractionated into three size classes. Microplankton and nanoplankton were significantly stimulated by both N (2.5 to 50 muM) and P (1 to 20 muM) additions. The severity of nutrient limitation was greatest during July. Picoplankton responded less strongly to N additions and were never P limited. These field data support laboratory studies which indicate that bacterium-sized phytoplankton use nutrients more efficiently and are superior competitors within mixed communities.},

The mean partial pressure of CO2 averaged 1036 microatmospheres, about three times the value in the overlying atmosphere, indicating that lakes are sources rather than sinks of atmospheric CO2. On a global scale, the potential efflux of CO2 from lakes (about 0.14 x 10(15) grams of carbon per year) is about half as large as riverine transport of organic plus inorganic carbon to the ocean. Lakes are a small but potentially important conduit for carbon from terrestrial sources to the atmospheric sink.},

abstract = {Algal biomass, in addition to cell numbers, is a measure of the successful conversion of inorganic to organic carbon. Consequently, carbon is themain currency used in aquatic models and in flux and budget studies. On the other hand, microscopic observation and counts remain the only means for determining species composition and biomass, which is relevant to many aspects of aquatic ecology. In this study, we focus on the way to convert biovolume to carbon biomass for algal assemblages of two rivers, using a computerized system that records dimensions of phytoplankton (Gosselain {\&} Hamilton, 2000). We first compare different equations found in the literature for converting algal cell volume to cellular carbon content.We then evaluate the accuracy of a biomass estimate based on less time-consuming measurements, using pre-determined biovolume values instead of measuring cells in all samples. Biovolume/carbon equations are evaluated using total phytoplankton carbon biomass determined from measured chlorophyll a. Equations established for freshwater taxa seem to provide better estimates of algal biomass in the two case studies presented here, the Rideau and Meuse rivers (Canada and Belgium, respectively) than do more numerous equations defined for marine taxa. Furthermore, equations that make a distinction between diatoms and other algae appear more appropriate than those considering all algal groups as a whole. Finally, mean values of algal biovolumes, determined using sufficient measurements of cell dimensions from representative sampling series, may prove sufficient for carbon estimates of taxa in relatively homogenous size ranges. The careful choice of appropriate volumetric shapes and taxa categories remains of prime importance to get precise results.},

Theoretical and empirically based models of k range in complexity from wind-driven power functions to complex surface renewal models; however, model choice is rarely considered in most studies of lake metabolism. This study used high-frequency data from 15 lakes provided by the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) to study how model choice of k influenced estimates of lake metabolism and gas exchange with the atmosphere. We tested 6 models of k on lakes chosen to span broad gradients in surface area and trophic states; a metabolism model was then fit to all 6 outputs of k data. We found that hourly values for k were substantially different between models and, at an annual scale, resulted in significantly different estimates of lake metabolism and gas exchange with the atmosphere.},

Here we report dissolved carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations from 12 rivers in sub-Saharan Africa, including seasonally resolved sampling at 39 sites, acquired between 2006 and 2014. Fluxes were calculated from published gas transfer velocities, and upscaled to the area of all sub-Saharan African rivers using available spatial data sets. Carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from river channels alone were about 0.4 Pg carbon per year, equivalent to two-thirds of the overall net carbon land sink previously reported for Africa. Including emissions from wetlands of the Congo river increases the total carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse-gas emissions to about 0.9 Pg carbon per year, equivalent to about one quarter of the global ocean and terrestrial combined carbon sink. Riverine carbon dioxide and methane emissions increase with wetland extent and upland biomass. We therefore suggest that future changes in wetland and upland cover could strongly affect greenhouse-gas emissions from African inland waters.},

Here we use long-term temperature data (1970-2010) from 26 lakes around the world to show that climate change has altered lake stratification globally and that the magnitudes of lake stratification changes are primarily controlled by lake morphometry (mean depth, surface area, and volume) and mean lake temperature. Deep lakes and lakes with high average temperatures have experienced the largest changes in lake stratification even though their surface temperatures tend to be warming more slowly. These results confirm that the nonlinear relationship between water density and water temperature and the strong dependence of lake stratification on lake morphometry makes lake temperature trends relatively poor predictors of lake stratification trends.},

abstract = {We investigated the effect of withdrawal of nutrient rich hypolimnic waters on diel changes in water column physicochemical conditions, composition of pelagic communities and metabolic processes over a 5-day period. The study was done during stratification in the eutrophic Kortowskie Lake divided into a southern experimental part with removal of near-bottom water by a pipe directly to the outlet, and a northern control part unaffected by the pipe. Volumetric metabolic rates with depth were calculated in each basin using 6 daily vertical profiles of dissolved oxygen (DO). Results demonstrated that withdrawal of near bottom water increased hypolimnic water temperature by 1.3°C decreasing the strength of thermal stratification. This increased phytoplankton biomass and primary production in the metalimnion of the experimental part of the lake, which became dominated by Cyanobacteria, and more net autotrophic compared to the photic zone of the control site. Daily variability in gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP=GPP–R) of the photic zone and metalimnion indicates the highly dynamic physical (mixing and light) and biological (pools of phytoplankton and bacteria) conditions occurring in the photic layers. In the control part of the lake, a multiple regression analysis showed that vertical patterns in GPP and R depended on phytoplankton biomass and total nitrogen and NEP followed changes in particulate organic carbon. In the experimental part of the lake, vertical patterns in NEP were only significantly related to changes in temperature. But as the temperature was positively correlated with bacterial abundance, this was most likely the main driver of variation in NEP with depth (relationship between R and medium cell volume (MCV), bacterial biomass (BB), respectively: r=0.60; r=−0.63; n=15; p{\textless}0.05, Pearson's correlation). The strong effects of hypolimnic withdrawal on physico-chemical and biological conditions shown by our short-term study, suggest that this method weakens thermal stratification, enhancing nutrient inputs from hypolimnic waters causing elevated phytoplankton biomass and primary production in metalimnetic and epilimnetic layers shifting the overall metabolic balance of the water column toward net autotrophy. On the other hand, biodegradation processes in higher temperature and intensive sinking of organic matter to the sediment and then removing by pipe directly to the outflow, reduce significantly phytoplankton biomass in the hypolimnion of experimental part of the lake.},

Net community production increased greatly with increasing irradiance, with the threshold irradiance for communities to become net autotrophic ranging from 42 to 255 mu E m(-2) s(-1), with net heterotrophic at lower irradiance. Examination of the contributions of the benthic and the pelagic compartments showed the pelagic compartment to be strongly heterotrophic (average P/R ratio = 0.27), indicating that the metabolism of the pelagic compartment is highly subsidised by excess organic carbon produced in the strongly autotrophic benthic compartment (average P/R = 1.58).},

abstract = {Concentrations of dissolved methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured in the water columns of non-oxygenated and artificially oxygenated, ice-covered eutrophied lakes in the mid-boreal zone in Finland during late winter 1997 and 1999. Sampling was conducted during winter stratification, the critical period for oxygen (O2) deficiency in seasonally ice-covered, thermally stratified lakes. Oxygen concentrations were maintained at least at a moderate level throughout the oxygenated water columns, whereas the non-oxygenated columns suffered anoxic hypolimnia. The mean concentrations of dissolved CH4 exceeding the atmospheric equilibrium were greater in the non-oxygenated water columns (20.6-154 microM) than in the oxygenated ones (0.01-1.41 microM). In contrast, the mean excess CO2 concentrations varied less between the non-oxygenated and oxygenated sites (0.28-0.47 and 0.25-0.31 mM, respectively). Oxygenated water columns had greater mean excess concentrations of N2O (0.018-0.032 microM) than the non-oxygenated ones (0.005-0.024 microM). If the accumulated greenhouse gas stores in the water columns during winter are assumed to be released to the atmosphere during the spring overturn, the global warming potentials (GWP, time horizon 100 yr) of these potential emissions at the non-oxygenated, eutrophic study sites ranged from 177 to 654 g CO2 equivalent (CO2-e) m-2 compared with 144 to 173 g CO2-e m-2 at the oxygenated sites. The increase in the accumulation of CH4 was the main reason for the higher GWP of the non-oxygenated sites. Anthropogenic eutrophication of lake ecosystems can generate increased CH4 emissions due to associated O2 depletion of their sediment and water column.},

abstract = {Organic carbon (OC) mineralization in freshwaters is dependent on oxygen availability near the sediments, which controls whether OC inputs will be buried or respired. However, oxygen dynamics in waterbodies are changing globally due to land use and climate, and the consequences of variable oxygen conditions for OC burial are unknown. We manipulated hypolimnetic oxygen availability in a whole-reservoir experiment and used a mass balance OC model to quantify rates of OC burial. Throughout summer stratification, we observed that OC burial rates were tightly coupled to sediment oxygen concentrations: oxic conditions pro- moted the mineralization of “legacy” OC that had accumulated over years of sedimentation, resulting in neg- ative OC burial. Moreover, our study demonstrates that fluctuating oxygen conditions can switch ecosystem- scale OC burial in a reservoir between positive and negative rates. Consequently, changing oxygen availabil- ity in freshwaters globally will likely have large implications for the role of these ecosystems as OC sinks.},

abstract = {1. Sources of atmospheric CH 4 are both naturally occurring and anthropogenic. In fact, some anthropogenic activities may influence the production of CH 4 from natural sources, such as lakes. 2. Ongoing changes in the catchment of lakes, including eutrophication and increased terrestrial organic carbon export, may affect CH 4 production rates as well as shape methanogen abundance and community structure. Therefore, inputs from catchments to lakes should be examined for their effects on CH 4 production. 3. We added algal and terrestrial carbon separately to lake sediment cores and measured CH 4 production. We also used quantitative polymerase chain reaction and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism to determine the effects of these carbon additions on methanogen abundance and community composition. 4. Our results indicate that CH 4 production rates were significantly elevated following the addition of algal biomass. Terrestrial carbon addition also appeared to increase methanogenesis rates; however, the observed increase was not statistically significant. 5. Interestingly, increased CH 4 production rates resulted from increases in per-cell activity rather than an increase in methanogen abundance or community compositional shifts, as indicated by our molecular analyses. 6. Overall, anthropogenic impacts on aquatic ecosystems can influence methanogenesis rates and should be considered in models of global methane cycling and climate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Thermal regime is strongly associated with hydrodynamics in water, and it plays an important role in the dynamics of water quality and ecosystem succession of stratified reservoirs. Changes in both climate and hydrological conditions can modify thermal regimes. Liuxihe Reservoir (23°45'50'N; 113°46'52'E) is a large, stratified and deep reservoir in Guangdong Province, located at the Tropic of Cancer of southern China. The reservoir is a warm monomictic water body with a long period of summer stratification and a short period of mixing in winter. The vertical distribution of suspended particulate material and nutrients are influenced strongly by the thermal structure and the associated flow fields. The hypolimnion becomes anoxic in the stratified period, increasing the release of nutrients from the bottom sediments. Fifty-one years of climate and reservoir operational observations are used here to show the marked changes in local climate and reservoir operational schemes. The data show increasing air temperature and more violent oscillations in inflow volumes in the last decade, while the inter-annual water level fluctuations tend to be more moderate. To quantify the effects of changes in climate and hydrological conditions on thermal structure, we used a numerical simulation model to create scenarios incorporating different air temperatures, inflow volumes, and water levels. The simulations indicate that water column stability, the duration of the mixing period, and surface and outflow temperatures are influenced by both natural factors and by anthropogenic factors such as climate change and reservoir operation schemes. Under continuous warming and more stable storage in recent years, the simulations indicate greater water column stability and increased duration of stratification, while irregular large discharge events may reduce stability and lead to early mixing in autumn. Our results strongly suggest that more attention should be focused on water quality in years of extreme climate variation and hydrological conditions, and selective withdrawal of deep water may provide an efficient means to reduce internal loading in warm years. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It is well recognized that dam construction aggravates eutrophication and hypoxia in river reservoirs, but the interaction between oxygen dynamics and carbon cycling is often unclear. Here we investigated the external and internal controls on oxygen consumption and effects of hypoxia on carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in a subtropical reservoir in southeast China based on detailed field measurements during 2017 and 2018. Hypoxia lasted 4 months starting in mid-July and expanded from the bottom to near surface water. Rainstorm hyperpycnal flow and unusual hydraulics (outflow exit 40 m from the bottom) resulted in two thermoclines and enhanced the oxygen deficit in deeper water. Microbial respiration accounted for 67.4{\%}–96.5{\%} of total oxygen consumption in the bottom water. The increased supply of organic matter from storm runoff and to a lesser extent primary production in summer enhanced subsequent oxygen consumption. We observed an imbalance between excess CO2 production and oxygen depletion in summer and winter which was likely associated with other processes in the hypolimnion (e.g., chemoautotrophy, anaerobic degradation of organic matter, proton buffering, and nitrification). The water-air CO2 fluxes suggest that the surface reservoir usually served as a CO2 source, but was a sink in summer due to high primary productivity. CO2 was always oversaturated in the hypolimnion; this layer was at the depth of the dam outflow and ultimately released 68{\%} of annual CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. This research confirmed that construction of a hydropower dam has substantially altered reservoir metabolism and regulated the CO2 emission pathway.},

It is process oriented and highlights the fascinating microorganisms that mediate anaerobic biogeochemistry. We begin this review with a brief discussion of CO2 assimilation by autotrophs, the source of most of the reducing power on Earth, and then consider the biological processes that harness this potential energy. Energy liberation begins with the decomposition of organic macromolecules to relatively simple compounds, which are simplified further by fermentation. Methanogenesis is considered next because CH4 is a product of acetate fermentation, and thus completes the catabolism of organic matter, particularly in the absence of inorganic electron acceptors. Finally, the organisms that use nitrogen, manganese, iron, and sulfur for terminal electron acceptors are considered in order of decreasing free-energy yield of the reactions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The effect of dams on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) transport and riverine ecosystems is unclear in karst cascade reservoirs. Here, we analyzed water samples from a karst river system with seven cascade reservoirs along the Wujiang River, southwestern China, during one hydrological year. From upstream to downstream, the average concentration of DIC increased from 2.2 to 2.6 mmol/L and its carbon isotope composition ($\delta$13CDIC) decreased from −8.0 to −10‰. Meanwhile, the air temperature (Ta) increased from 20.3 °C to 26.7 °C and 10 °C to 13.7 °C in the warm and cold seasons, respectively. The results suggest that a cascade of dams has a stronger effect on DIC dynamics and retention than a single dam. The good correlation between Ta/HRT (hydraulic retention time) and $\Delta$[DIC] as well as $\Delta$[$\delta$13CDIC] mean that Ta and HRT affected the magnitude of the damming effect by altering changes in concentration of DIC and $\delta$13CDIC in the reservoir compared to the inflowing water. In particular, daily regulated reservoirs with short retention times acted more like river corridors and had a smaller effect on carbon dynamics, so modulating retention time might be used reduce the effect of dams on the riverine ecosystem.},

abstract = {The importance of in-lake generation of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) to the neutralization of acidic deposition has been determined for an acidic Adirondack (NY) lake relative to its surrounding watershed. Microbial processes within the sediments of Dart's lake significantly altered the aqueous chemistry of the hypolimnion. Reduction of NO3{\^{}}- and SO4{\^{}}2- and the production of NH4{\^{}}+ contributed 45, 14, and 32{\%}, respectively, to the production of hypolimnetic ANC. The reduction of NO3{\^{}}- was a more significant source of ANC generation than has been reported in other lake districts. On an areal basis, in-lake ANC generation (2990 equiv ha{\^{}}-1 yr{\^{}}-1) was greater than terrestrial ANC production (1204 equiv ha{\^{}}-1 yr{\^{}}-1). However on a watershed basis, in-lake ANC generation was minor ({\textless}5{\%}) due to the short hydraulic retention time of Dart's Lake. Neutralization of acidic precipitation in the Adirondack region predominantly occurs in the terrestrial system since the hydraulic retention time of Adirondack lakes is short.},

abstract = {Theory predicts, and some evidence demonstrates that in lakes, the depth of the thermo cline can have a large structural influence on the spatial distribution, and strongly influences the composition of plankton communities. However, experimental assessments of responses of the planktonic food web to thermo cline depth have not yet been done at the whole-basin scale. We conducted an experiment wherein we artificially lowered the thermo cline in an isolated basin of a three-basin lake, maintaining another isolated basin as a control. The vertical distribution and taxonomic composition of both phytoplankton and zooplankton were monitored throughout the summer months. Greater phytoplankton production, especially in the epilimnion, attributable mainly to increases in the chlorophytes was observed with thermocline deepening, but at the deepest thermoclines, production was limited. Total zooplankton biomass was unaffected by thermocline depth, suggesting top-down control by predators. Zooplankton biomass peaks were less pronounced in the manipulated basin, but tended to follow the thermocline whether at its normal position or as it was deepened. Zooplankton composition was significantly altered by large increases in densities of predatory cyclopoid copepods and rotifers; taxa commonly found in turbulent environments. Overall, both phytoplankton and zooplankton communities demonstrated important shifts in structure and composition in response to thermocline deepening.},

abstract = {The horizontal distribution of phytoplankton in a medium-size canyon type reservoir, forced by weak winds of 3–4 ms-1, is largely driven by the interaction of the large-scale circulation and processes regulating the vertical distribution of algal cells in the water column. These drivers, in turn, are subject to diurnal variations, making our understanding of the horizontal distribution of phytoplankton a challenging task. A three-dimensional physical-–ecological model is used to understand the spa- tial distribution of algae and the role of diurnal variations in the physical–biological drivers. The model was used to demonstrate that the large-scale circulation induced during the day is more efficient generating patchiness than the circulation existing at night, when convectively driven turbulence homogenizes the upper layers. Different spatial distributions develop for different populations and under different forcing scenarios, characterized in terms of the directionality of wind forcing, wind magnitude and the lags between winds and diel heat fluxes. The time scales needed so that algal biomass in the surface exhibit significant longitudinal gradients—TP—will vary depending on the algal group, and its ability to regulate its vertical position. These scales are shorter for those species that either migrate actively in the water column or exhibit positive buoyancy (Cryptophytes or Positive buoyant algae). In El Gergal, these scales TP are on the order of a few days. Synoptic changes in the meteorological forcing, like the passing of a front, could potentially change the longitudinal distribution of algal biomass if they persist for periods of time longer than Tp.},

abstract = {Despite significant contributions of inland lakes to the global methane cycle, we lack a process-based understanding of what regulates inter-lake variation in methane emissions. Previous comparative work has identified a potential link between lake primary productivity and methane emissions; also, lab-scale experiments suggest that the addition of algal substrate to anoxic sediments rapidly enhances rates of methanogenesis. This existing work indicates that primary productivity could enhance lake contributions to the global methane cycle. However, a more systematic investigation of the links between lake primary production, methanogenesis, and methane emission to the atmosphere is required to quantify the implications of increased cultural eutrophication for methane evasion from lakes. Using paired measurements of methanogenesis and methane emissions on 16 north temperate lakes, we documented a positive relationship between lake productivity and sediment methanogenesis rates. However, increased methanogenesis rates did not result in an increase in diffusive methane emissions. Rather, they generated greater methane storage during summer stratification and enhanced methane emission to the atmosphere via bubbling (ebullition), dependent on site depth. Ebullition most frequently occurred at sites less than 6 m deep and where methanogenesis rates were high. The relationships between lake productivity, methanogenesis, and depth-dependent ebullition suggests it is likely that shallow, productive lakes contribute significantly more methane to the atmosphere than deep, clear lakes and will continue to do so in light of the growing prevalence of lake eutrophication.},

abstract = {We use high quality climate data from ground meteorological stations in the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and robust drought indices to confirm that drought severity has increased in the past five decades, as a consequence of greater atmospheric evaporative demand resulting from temperature rise. Increased drought severity is independent of the model used to quantify the reference evapotranspiration. We have also focused on drought impacts to drought-sensitive systems, such as river discharge, by analyzing streamflow data for 287 rivers in the IP, and found that hydrological drought frequency and severity have also increased in the past five decades in natural, regulated and highly regulated basins. Recent positive trend in the atmospheric water demand has had a direct influence on the temporal evolution of streamflows, clearly identified during the warm season, in which higher evapotranspiration rates are recorded. This pattern of increase in evaporative demand and greater drought severity is probably applicable to other semiarid regions of the world, including other Mediterranean areas, the Sahel, southern Australia and South Africa, and can be expected to increasingly compromise water supplies and cause political, social and economic tensions among regions in the near future. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent hypotheses, based on atmospheric records and models, suggest that permafrost carbon (PF-C) accumulated during the last glaciation may have been an important source for the atmospheric CO2 rise during post-glacial warming. However, direct physical indications for such PF-C release have so far been absent. Here we use the Laptev Sea (Arctic Ocean) as an archive to investigate PF-C destabilization during the last glacial–interglacial period. Our results show evidence for massive supply of PF-C from Siberian soils as a result of severe active layer deepening in response to the warming. Thawing of PF-C must also have brought about an enhanced organic matter respiration and, thus, these findings suggest that PF-C may indeed have been an important source of CO2 across the extensive permafrost domain. The results challenge current paradigms on the post-glacial CO2 rise and, at the same time, serve as a harbinger for possible consequences of the present-day warming of PF-C soils. Atmospheric CO2 increases during the last deglaciation have been linked to the destabilisation of permafrost carbon reservoirs. Here, using a sediment core from the Laptev Sea, Tesi et al. indicate a massive supply of permafrost carbon was released from Siberia following active layer deepening.},

abstract = {We used a combination of porewater and solid phase analysis, as well as a series of sediment incubations, to quantify organic carbon oxidation by dissimilatory Fe reduction, Mn reduction, and sulfate reduction, in sediments from the Skagerrak (located off the northeast coast of Jutland, Denmark). In the deep portion of the basin, surface Mn enrichments reached 3.5 wt{\%}, and Mn reduction was the only important anaerobic carbon oxidation process in the upper 10 cm of the sediment. In the less Mnrich sediments from intermediate depths in the basin, Fe reduction ranged from somewhat less, to far more important than sulfate reduction. Most of the Mn reduction in these sediments may have been coupled to the oxidation of acid volatile sulfides (AVS), rather than to dissimilatory reduction. High rates of metal oxide reduction at all sites were driven by active recycling of both Fe and Mn, encouraged by bioturbation. Recycling was so rapid that the residence time of Fe and Mn oxides, with respect to reduction, ranged from 70-250 days. These results require that, on average, an atom of Fe or Mn is oxidized and reduced between 100-300 times before ultimate burial into the sediment. We observed that dissolved Mn2+ was completely removed onto fully oxidized Mn oxides until the oxidation level of the oxides was reduced to about 3.8, presumably reflecting the saturation by Mn2+ of highly reactive surface adsorption sites. Fully oxidized Mn oxides in sediments, then, may act as a cap preventing Mn2+ escape. We speculate that in shallow sediments of the Skagerrak, surface Mn oxides are present in a somewhat reduced oxidation level ({\textless}3.8) allowing Mn2+ to escape, and perhaps providing the Mn2+ which enriches sediments of the deep basin. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {1. The concentration of sulphate is low in lakes and sulphur cycling has often been neglected in studies of organic matter diagenesis in lake sediments. The cycling of sulphur is, however, both spatially and temporally dynamic and strongly influences many biogeochemical reactions in sediments, such as the binding of phosphorus. This review examines the control of sulphate reduction and sulphur cycling in sediments of lakes with different trophic status. 2. The factors that control the rate of sulphate reduction have not been identified with certainty in the various environments because many factors are involved, e.g. oxygen and sulphate concentrations, temperature and organic matter availability. 3. Sulphate reduction is less significant under oligotrophic conditions, where mineralization is dominated by oxic decomposition. The supply of organic matter may not be sufficient to support sulphate reduction in the anoxic parts of sediments and, also, sulphate availability may control the rate as the concentration is generally low in oligotrophic lakes. 4. There is a potential for significant sulphate reduction in eutrophic lakes, as both the availability of organic matter and sulphate concentration are often higher than in oligotrophic lakes. Sulphate is rapidly depleted with sediment depth, however, and methanogenesis is generally the most important process in overall carbon mineralization. Sulphate reduction is generally low in acidic lakes because of low sulphate availability and reduced microbial activity. 5. It is still unclear which of the forms of sulphur deposits are the most important and under which conditions burial occurs. Sulphur deposition is controlled by the rate of sulphate reduction and reoxidation. Reoxidation of sulphides occurs rapidly through several pathways, both under oxic and anoxic conditions. Only a few studies have been able to examine the importance of reoxidation, but it is hypothesized that most of the reoxidation takes place under anoxic conditions and that disproportionation is often involved. The presence of sulphide oxidizing bacteria, benthic fauna and rooted macrophytes may substantially enhance oxic reoxidation. Deposition of sulphur is generally higher in eutrophic than in oligotrophic lakes because of a number of factors: a higher rate of sulphate reduction, enhanced sedimentation of organic sulphur and less reoxidation as a result of reduced penetration of oxygen into the sediments, a lack of faunal activity and rooted macrophytes.},

The size spectrum of ingested particles was broad and even included filamentous cyanobacteria such as the com- monly dominating Arthrospira fusiformis. Feeding selectivity on cyanobacteria, however, was rather low showing higher values for cryptomonads and small ciliates. Bacterial biomass was favoured by the presence of grazers, as small bacterivorous predators were reduced at an average of 13.9{\%}, showing the cascading effect of large zooplankton on the food web structure. Overall, based on this first-time study of the microzooplankton feeding behaviour in East African soda lakes, a strong structuring effect of rotifers and large ciliates on microbial plankton communities is assumed, especially in times of high consumer biomass.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The dependence of growth and photosythesis on cell size in diatoms is evaluated in terms of an energy-balance model of microalgal physiology. Based on a review of available observations it appears that cell size can account for much of the interspecific variability in maximum growth rate (p,,,) and in optical absorption cross-section (ach,). Both CL, and a,,, decrease with increases in cell size. Cell size does not appear to influence the chlorophyll a:carbon ratio, the quantum efficiency of photosyn- thesis nor the photon flux density (PFD) at which growth rate is llght-saturated. Available observations do not allow an evaluation of the size dependence of maintenance metabolic rates or the PFD at which light compensation of growth occurs. This analysis confirms the competitive advantage of small cell size of microalgae under nutrient-sufficient conditions at both light-saturating and light-limiting growth rates to the extent that small-celled diatoms have enhanced catalytic efficiencies of growth and light absorption.},

abstract = {This study investigates how food web structures in aquatic microbial communities emerge based on different mixotrophic life strategies. Unicellular mixotrophic organisms that combine osmotrophy and primary production with phagotrophy account for significant amounts of primary production and bacterivory in marine environments, yet mixotrophs are still usually absent in large-scale biogeochemical models. We here present for the first time a thorough analysis of a food web model with a finely resolved structure in both cell size and foraging mode, where foraging mode is a strategy ranging from pure osmotrophy to pure phagotrophy. A trade-off for maximum uptake rates of mixotrophs is incorporated. We study how different factors determine the food web structure, here represented by the topology of the distribution of given amounts of total phosphorous over the cell sizeforaging mode plane. We find that mixotrophs successfully coexist with foraging specialists (pure osmo- and phagotrophs) for a wide range of conditions, a result consistent with the observed prevalence of mixotrophs in recent oceanographic surveys. Mixotrophy trade-off and size-dependent parameters have a strong effect on the emerging community structure, stressing the importance of foraging mode and size considerations when working with microbial diversity and food web dynamics. The proposed model may be used to develop timely representations of mixotrophic strategies in larger biogeochemical ocean models.},

In this sense, the present study aimed at understanding temporal dynamics of some trophic relevant water quality parameters in different time scales and their correlation and influence in phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll {\textless}em{\textgreater}a{\textless}/em{\textgreater}) in a shallow subtropical coastal lake. Peri Lake is located in Florian{\'{o}}polis island in Southern Brazil and samples were taken monthly between March 2007 and February 2013. The lake showed low dissolved nutrients concentration, especially phosphorus (P) (median dissolved P: 2.0 µg.l{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater})  and high chlorophyll {\textless}em{\textgreater}a{\textless}/em{\textgreater} (median: 20.8 µg.l{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) concentration. Total nitrogen (TN) concentration varied broadly, with a median of 672.8 µg L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, and total P (TP) concentration was low (median: 13.5 µg L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). A seasonal pattern of variation concerning dissolved and total P and chlorophyll a concentration was observed, associated mainly with temperature and wind speeds, but no clear pattern was observed for nitrogen (N) fractions. Significant differences were observed in different years for some parameters, with higher chlorophyll a and lower N concentration in the last three years sampled. The lake was considered potentially P limited during the majority of the study period and a positive correlation was found between chlorophyll {\textless}em{\textgreater}a{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and total and dissolved P concentration. Phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll {\textless}em{\textgreater}a{\textless}/em{\textgreater}) was apparently controlled by water temperature and P availability (TN:TP ratio and dissolved P). Water transparency (as Secchi depth) was strongly and negatively influenced by chlorophyll {\textless}em{\textgreater}a{\textless}/em{\textgreater} concentration. {\textless}em{\textgreater}Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii{\textless}/em{\textgreater} abilities to compete for P and light seem to be important factors determining its success and dominance in this low P coastal ecosystem. The fluctuating P supply, probably associated to sediment resuspension by wind in this shallow waterbody, is an advantageous factor for cyanobacteria and has an important role in chlorophyll {\textless}em{\textgreater}a{\textless}/em{\textgreater} dynamics. Thus, high chlorophyll {\textless}em{\textgreater}a{\textless}/em{\textgreater} concentration in this subtropical lake seems to be related to the P-limited condition, shallowness and low water column transparency, which are probably favouring the dominance of {\textless}em{\textgreater}C. raciborskii{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, especially in higher summer temperatures, and leading to high chlorophyll {\textless}em{\textgreater}a{\textless}/em{\textgreater} concentration even in a low dissolved nutrient environment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Tropical reservoirs have been identified as important methane (CH 4) sources to the atmosphere, primarily through turbine and downstream degassing. However, the importance of ebullition (gas bubbling) remains unclear. We hypothesized that ebullition is a disproportionately large CH 4 source from reservoirs with dendritic littoral zones because of ebullition hot spots occurring where rivers supply allochthonous organic material. We explored this hypothesis in Lake Kariba (Zambia/Zimbabwe; surface area {\textgreater}5000 km 2) by surveying ebullition in bays with and without river inputs using an echosounder and traditional surface chambers. The two techniques yielded similar results, and revealed substantially higher fluxes in river deltas (10 3 mg CH 4 m -2 d -1) compared to nonriver bays ({\textless}100 mg CH 4 m -2 d -1). Hydroacoustic measurements resolved at 5 m intervals showed that flux events varied over several orders of magnitude (up to 10 5 mg CH 4 m -2 d -1), and also identified strong differences in ebullition frequency. Both factors contributed to emission differences between all sites. A CH 4 mass balance for the deepest basin of Lake Kariba indicated that hot spot ebullition was the largest atmospheric emission pathway, suggesting that future greenhouse gas budgets for tropical reservoirs should include a spatially well-resolved analysis of ebullition hot spots. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A novel sediment bubble gas sampler and a subsurface bubble gas collector were designed to measure the ebullition of gases from profundal sediments of aquatic ecosystems. The sediment gas sampler was constructed to collect bubble gas samples directly from the uppermost sediment layers for gas composition analysis. The floating subsurface gas collector, designed to trap the bubbles released naturally from sediments, permitted the measurement of both the volume and the composition of the bubble gas. Due to its low cost, light weight and rapid sampling capability, the gas collector is ideal for studies requiring many replicate collectors. These devices were used for {\v{Z}}. {\v{Z}}. measurement of the ebullition of methane CH and carbon dioxide CO during an open water period from 4 2 hypereutrophic Lake Postilampi, situated within the midboreal zone in Finland. The bubble gas obtained from the sediment with the sediment gas sampler had higher concentrations of CH and CO than the bubbles trapped in the 4 2 gas collectors. This indicated that the bubble gas composition changed, either naturally during the migration of the bubbles from the sediment through the water column to the gas collectors, andror during their storage in the collectors prior to sampling. The mean CH ebullition from Lake Postilampi was estimated to be in the range from 4 36 to 46 mg m y2 d y1 , based on the bubble gas CH concentrations measured from the gas collectors and sediment, 4 respectively. The bubbles contained only 0.020.57{\%} of CO and thus, the ebullition had no significance in the 2 release of CO from the lake. J.T.

abstract = {Many freshwater lakes are supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. This concentration gradient implies a net flux of CO2 from the water to the air. The actual rate of gas exchange is governed by both this concentration gradient and the gas transfer coefficient, k. To directly measure k, we added the chemically and biologically inert gas, sulfur hexaflouride (SF6), to the epilimnion of Mirror Lake, New Hampshire, a small (15 ha), low-wind softwater lake. k was independent of wind speed over the 50-d summer stratification period and averaged 2.65 ± 0.12 cm h-1 (95{\%} CI; normalized to a Schmidt number of 600); k800 was better correlated to precipitation events than it was to wind speed. Our data support the idea that gas exchange across the air-water interface is largely independent of wind at low wind speeds. The surface water of Mirror Lake was persistently supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. During a 3.5-year period the partial pressure of CO2 in the surface waters of the lake averaged 726 ± 39 $\mu$atm (95{\%} CI) and showed substantial seasonal variation (360-2,000 $\mu$atm). Diel and day-to-day variation in CO2 were very small compared to the CO2 pool. We combined our estimates of k with weekly measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 to estimate CO2 gas exchange in the lake. Mirror Lake released from 26 to 50 g C m-2 to the atmosphere each year, depending on the method of calculating k. Atmospheric CO2 exchange is a large term in the C economy of the lake-the most conservative gas flux estimate is about four times as large as outflow plus seepage of total dissolved inorganic carbon and 1.5 times as large as the export of dissolved organic C from the lake.},

abstract = {A field study was conducted in Lake Simcoe to examine variations in turbulent mixing rates for a 40-day period in late summer of 2011. High sampling frequency records of water currents and temperature profiles were acquired using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a chain of fast-response temperature loggers respectively. The acquired data were processed to quantify the relative strengths of the stratification in relation to the velocity shear, expressed by the dimensionless gradient Richardson number (Rig). We then used the calculated Rig as a proxy to estimate vertical turbulent eddy diffusivity (Kz) in the stratified water column of the lake. Kz exhibited large spatial and temporal variability with frequent high values in the epilimnion (Kz {\~{}}10-5-10-4m2s-1), and relatively low values in the metalimnion (Kz {\~{}}10-7-10-6m2s-1) and the hypolimnion (Kz {\~{}}10-6-10-5m2s-1). We correlated the Kz variability with the environmental forcing through the Lake number (LN), which expresses the relative strengths of the stratification to the wind forcing. Analysis of the environmental implications of Kz variability suggested that vertical turbulent transport of dissolved oxygen was 10{\%} of the total oxygen depleted in the hypolimnion for the observation period. We concluded that at least some of the observed year-to-year variability of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion could be due to the variation in turbulent transport of dissolved oxygen across the thermocline.},

abstract = {The usefulness and relevance of size-based indicators (SBIs) to an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) are assessed through a review of empirical and modelling studies. SBIs are tabulated along with their definitions, data requirements, potential biases, availability of time-series, and expected directions of change in response to fishing pressure. They include mean length in a population, mean length in a community, mean maximum length in a community, and the slope and intercept of size spectra. Most SBIs can be derived from fairly standard survey data on length frequencies, without the need for elaborate models. Possible fishing- and environment-induced effects are analysed to distinguish between the two causes, and hypothetical cases of reference directions of change are tabulated. We conclude that no single SBI can serve as an effective overall indicator of heavy fishing pressure. Rather, suites of SBI should be selected, and reference directions may be more useful than reference points. Further modelling and worldwide comparative studies are needed to provide better understanding of SBIs and the factors affecting them. The slow response to fishing pressure reflects the complexity of community interactions and ecosystem responses, and prohibits their application in the context of short-term (annual) tactical fisheries management. However, movement towards longer-term (5-10 years) strategic management in EAF should facilitate their use. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {We advance a method to determine the diameter D and the complex refractive index ͑n ϩ nЈi͒ of marine particles from flow cytometric measurements of forward scattering, side scattering, and chlorophyll fluorescence combined with Mie theory. To understand better the application of Mie theory with its assumptions to flow cytometry ͑FCM͒ measurements of phytoplankton cells, we evaluate our flow cytometric-Mie ͑FCM-Mie͒ method by comparing results from a variety of phytoplankton cultures with independent estimates of cell D and with estimates of n and nЈ from the inversion of bulk measurements. Cell D initially estimated from the FCM-Mie method is lower than independent estimates, and n and nЈ are generally higher than bulk estimates. These differences reflect lower forward scattering and higher side scattering for single-cell measurements than predicted by Mie theory. The application of empirical scattering corrections improves FCM-Mie estimates of cell size, n, and nЈ; notably size is determined accurately for cells grown in both high-and low-light conditions, and nЈ is correlated with intracellular chlorophyll concentration. A comparison of results for phytoplankton and mineral particles suggests that differences in n between these particle types can be determined from FCM measurements. In application to natural mixtures of particles, eukaryotic pico͞nanophytoplankton and Synechococcus have minimum mean values of nЈ in surface waters, and nonphytoplankton particles have higher values of n than phytoplankton at all depths.},

We compared a suite of limnological variables among 1033 reservoirs and natural lakes across multiple size classes on a latitudinal gradient in the conterminous United States. In general, reservoirs had significantly greater perimeters, catchment areas, and catchment area:surface area ratios than natural lakes. Interestingly, several lakeshore land use, morphometric, and water quality response variables exhibited significant interactions between waterbody type and latitude. Southern reservoirs were deeper and had higher proportions of forested land and less agriculture and developed land use in their lakeshore than southern natural lakes, whereas northern reservoirs were shallower and had less forest and more agriculture and developed land in their lakeshore than northern natural lakes. Following the waterbody depth and land use data, natural lakes also had greater total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and shallower Secchi disk depths at lower latitudes, whereas reservoirs had greater TP concentrations and shallower Secchi disk depths at higher latitudes. Overall, natural lakes were more eutrophic than reservoirs, having greater total nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations, regardless of latitude. Our findings indicate that many physical, chemical, and lakeshore land use characteristics of reservoirs and natural lakes vary on a latitudinal gradient, which has implications for the water quality, ecology, and management of these waterbodies.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel tool, ThSSim, for simulation of thermal stratification (ThS) in reservoirs. ThSSim is a simple and flexible reduced-order model-based the basis function (RMBF) that combines CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). In a case study, it was used to simulate water temperature in the Karkheh Reservoir (KR), Iran, for the period 2019–2035. ThSSim consists of two space- and time-dependent components that add predictive ability to the RMBF, a major refinement that extends its practical applications. Water temperature simulations by the W2 model at three-hour time intervals for the KR were used as input data to the POD model to develop ThSSim. To add predictive ability to ThSSim and considering that space-dependent components are not a function of time, we extrapolated the first three time-dependent components by September 30, 2035. We checked the predictive ability of ThSSim against water temperature profiles measured during eight sampling campaigns. We then applied ThSSim to simulate water temperature in the KR for 2019–2035. Simulated water temperature values matched well those measured and obtained by W2. ThSSim results showed an increasing trend for surface water temperature during the simulation period, with a reverse trend observed for water temperature in the bottom layers for three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). The results also indicated decreasing and increasing trends in onset and breakdown of thermal stability, respectively, so that the duration of ThS increased from 278 days in 2019 to 293 days in 2035. ThSSim is thus useful for reservoir temperature simulations. Moreover, the approach used to develop ThSSim is widely applicable to other fields of science and engineering.},

abstract = {1. Anthropogenic activities can increase fine sediment supply to streams over multiple spatial and temporal extents. Identifying the processes responsible, and the scale at which any effects on stream organisms become evident, are key management needs, but appropriately scaled surveys are surprisingly few. 2. We surveyed macroinvertebrates and superficial fine sediments at two spatial resolutions (reach- and patch-scale) in tributaries of the River Usk, a temperate, montane catchment in rural Wales (U.K.). Land use, habitat and geomorphological character were measured on-site or derived from an existing database (=Fluvial Audit). We aimed to identify: (i) how in-stream sediments varied with land use and associated geomorphology; (ii) likely consequences for macroinvertebrates and (iii) any scale-dependence in relationships between macroinvertebrates and sediment character. 3. At both the reach- and patch-scales, bed cover by fine sediment was related directly to the extent of eroding banks 500 m upstream. In turn, sedimentation and bank erosion were negatively correlated with catchment or riparian woodland extent. 4. At the reach scale, macroinvertebrate composition varied with catchment land use and stream chemistry, with richness declining as rough grazing or woodland was replaced by improved grassland. There was no response to deposited sediment except for weak increase in the relative abundance of oligochaetes. 5. By contrast, at the patch scale, fine sediments were accompanied by pronounced changes in invertebrate composition, and we ranked the 27 most common taxa according to their apparent sediment tolerance. General estimating equations showed that total and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera richness decreased significantly by 20{\%} and 25{\%} at the most sediment impacted sites (30{\%} cover) by comparison with sediment-free sites. 6. We conclude that sediment deposition in the upper Usk system mostly reflects local bank erosion, with riparian woodland likely to mediate this process through bank stability. Fine sediment release had marked ecological effects, but these were detectable only at patch-to-patch scales. We suggest that investigation of localized sediment release in streams will benefit from scale-dependent or scale-specific sampling, and some effects could go undetected unless sample resolution is selected carefully. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {The production, oxidation, and transport of methane (CH4) from a boreal beaver pond were measured during the ice-free period in order to explain the observed flux of CH4 between the pond and the atmosphere. The study pond was located in the northern study area (NSA) of the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), near Thompson, Manitoba. Three pathways transported the CH4 produced in the rich, organic anaerobic sediments. In order of importance they were: bubble flux (ebullition), diffusion, and plant transport. The water-air flux of CH4 was related to windspeed and sediment temperature, whereas the bubble flux also showed a degree of synchronicity with changes in atmospheric pressure and water level. By mid-June the storage of CH4 in the sediments reached a quasi steady-state, and production minus oxidation approximated the water-air exchange. Since the dominant pathway of ebullition is little affected by oxidation, the mean unit area flux of CH4 for the vegetated and open portions of the beaver pond (155 and 320 mg CH4 m-2day-1) were larger than the flux observed in most wetlands of the NSA. CH4 in bubbles from vegetated sites was significantly enriched in 13C and significantly depleted in 2H relative to bubbles from open water sites, consistent with a shift in methane production mechanism from acetate fermentation to CO2 reduction for the vegetated and unvegetated sites, respectively. The radiocarbon content of methane was not different between the two types of sites (114.7 ± 4.2pMC, vegetated versus 108.1±6.5pMC, open water).},

abstract = {Earlier field studies conducted in reservoirs have shown that outlet selection may influence the abundance and composition of phytoplankton assemblages, and therefore, could be a promising technique for reservoir water quality management and restoration. However, the mechanisms by which phytoplankton assemblages are modified as a consequence of hydraulic regulation are not well understood. In this work, these mechanisms are analyzed. Outflow-driven changes in algal growth occur as a consequence either of water containing algal cells being withdrawn at or near the level of the outlets (flushing), or of changes in the environmental conditions (temperature, light and nutrient concentration) induced by such withdrawals. The study is based on simulations of phytoplankton growth in a small reservoir conducted with a simple physical-ecological model including two algal groups with different adaptations to environmental conditions. Our simulations suggest that the response of the phytoplankton assemblage to withdrawals depends on (a) the position of the layer hosting algal cells; (b) the depth of the water column; (c) the shape and size of the reservoir; (d) the relative position of the level of water extraction and the depth of the layer hosting algal cells; (e) the response of each algal group to environmental condition (in particular light availability); and (f) the outflow regime, identified in terms of the outflow rates and variability. Stratification conditions and meteorological forcing are also important in modulating the effects of outflows on algal growth. Outflow-driven changes of the dominant group in the algal assemblage mainly occur as a consequence of flushing (about 80{\%} of the cases). Four scenarios are identified in which outflows induce changes in the dominant group of the algal assemblage purely as a result of environmental changes. The implications for reservoir water quality management are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

However, little is known about the effects of water stratification and mixing on the aquatic microbial community dynamics in subtropical reservoirs. In this study, we explored vertical and seasonal patterns of microbial diversity in the Dongzhen Reservoir (southeast China). Quantitative PCR, quantitative RT-PCR, and 454 pyrosequencing were used for an in-depth characterization of the bacterial community across time (every three months for one year) and space (five different water depths). Our results indicated that thermal and oxygen stratification shaped the phylogenetic composition of microbial communities in the reservoir. There were significant differences in physical, chemical and microbiological parameters between epilimnion and hypolimnion (P {\textless} 0.05). The RNA: DNA ratios were significantly lower in epilimnion and metalimnion but rapidly increased in hypolimnion (P {\textless} 0.05), suggesting that microorganisms were more active at low temperatures, low dissolved oxygen concentrations and high TN/TP ratios. Redundancy analysis and pathway analysis revealed a complex interplay of various environmental and biological factors by explaining the spatiotemporal variations in bacterial communities. Adaptive reservoir management strategies should consider carefully the effects of water stratification and mixing, together with the distribution patterns of aquatic microorganisms.},

abstract = {Methane-utilizing bacteria (methanotrophs) are a diverse group of gram- negative bacteria that are related to other members of the Proteobacteria. These bacteria are classified into three groups based on the pathways used for assimilation of formaldehyde, the major source of cell carbon, and other physiological and morphological features. The type I and type X methanotrophs are found within the gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria and employ the ribulose monophosphate pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, whereas type II methanotrophs, which employ the serine pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, form a coherent cluster within the beta subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Methanotrophic bacteria are ubiquitous. The growth of type II bacteria appears to be favored in environments that contain relatively high levels of methane, low levels of dissolved oxygen, and limiting concentrations of combined nitrogen and/or copper. Type I methanotrophs appear to be dominant in environments in which methane is limiting and combined nitrogen and copper levels are relatively high. These bacteria serve as biofilters for the oxidation of methane produced in anaerobic environments, and when oxygen is present in soils, atmospheric methane is oxidized. Their activities in nature are greatly influenced by agricultural practices and other human activities. Recent evidence indicates that naturally occurring, uncultured methanotrophs represent new genera. Methanotrophs that are capable of oxidizing methane at atmospheric levels exhibit methane oxidation kinetics different from those of methanotrophs available in pure cultures. A limited number of methanotrophs have the genetic capacity to synthesize a soluble methane monooxygenase which catalyzes the rapid oxidation of environmental pollutants including trichloroethylene.},

abstract = {The concentrations of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) in the water column have extremely important effects on the water quality of drinking water reservoirs; however, reservoirs often experience problematic Fe and Mn levels during seasonal stratification and rainfall events. Water-lifting aerators (WLAs) were deployed in the Jinpen Reservoir to control these issues with Fe and Mn at the source via bottom aeration and artificial destratification. In this study, variations of Fe and Mn concentrations in the water column, porewater, and sediments, were used to characterize behaviors of reduced Fe and Mn under the conditions of hypolimnetic aeration and artificial destratification during periods of hypolimnion hypoxia and rainfall events. The results showed that replenishing aquatic oxygen levels by aeration can effectively decrease the dissolved Fe and Mn in the water column thereby increasing the sedimentation rate and the diffusive flux of Fe and Mn at the sediment-water interface (SWI). The dissolved Fe was significantly chemically oxidized and the concentration remained relatively low in the water column during WLA operations, while dissolved Mn persistently accumulated in the near-sediment regions because of its complex kinetics. Our in situ profiles of labile Fe and Mn in the sediments demonstrated that the diffusive flux of Mn (JMn) was largely increased by the increased concentration gradient at the SWI, while the diffusive flux of Fe (JFe) decreased. The sediments were observed to rapidly become anoxic and release Fe and Mn after WLA deactivation; this emphasized the importance of appropriate operations linking the artificial and natural mixing periods to prevent SWI hypoxia and the release of reduced substances.},

abstract = {The role of lacustrine systems in the global carbon cycle is a major topic in freshwater research. Most lakes release inorganic carbon to the atmosphere owing to the imbalance of net metabolism toward respiration. Most research on this topic relies on data collected in natural low-alkalinity lakes, and it therefore remains unclear what role human-made calcareous lakes play in the current paradigm. In this study, we reported inorganic carbon fluxes and net ecosystem production in a calcareous human-made reservoir in Spain using mass balances of inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen. The inorganic carbon loadings reported are among the largest found in the literature, and the inorganic carbon pool in the reservoir depends on the net hydrological balance. The reservoir was identified as a net emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) and showed persistent net heterotrophy, although we could not find any clear dependence of CO2 emissions on the metabolic balance. The variability of inorganic carbon and the net ecosystem production were poorly correlated, suggesting that additional internal processes govern the transformation of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the water column. Considering the significant decrease in surface alkalinity occurring during the summer, carbonate precipitation may be the dominant process confounding the relationship between metabolism and inorganic carbon variability. These results indicate that the CO2 dynamics may be weakly coupled to net metabolism in calcareous systems and that net heterotrophy may occur simultaneously with eutrophic conditions and low dissolved organic carbon concentration in flushed systems such as reservoirs.

We find that large cells may be favored when (1) phytoplankton growth is limited by the rate at which internally stored inorganic nutrients can be converted into biomass, and (2) maximum quotas increase with size faster than minimum quotas. Increased internal quotas then accelerate the rate of biomass production in large cells, despite their enhanced requirements for resources.

We developed a mechanistic model that integrates the reactivity continuum (RC) concept to reconstruct in-lake mineralization of DOCalloch under variable hydrologic conditions using empirical measurements of DOCalloch concentrations and reactivity as model inputs.

The modeled DOCalloch mineralization rates and concentrations were in agreement with expectations based on observed and published values of ambient lake DOC concentrations and reactivity. Results from this modeling exercise reveal that the interaction between WRT and k 0 is a key determinant of the ambient concentration and reactivity of lake DOCalloch, which represents the bulk of DOC in most of these lakes. The steady-state {\$}{\$} $\backslash$left( {\{}$\backslash$bar{\{}K{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}alloch{\}}{\}} {\}} $\backslash$right) {\$}{\$} also represents the proportion of CO2 that can be extracted from DOCalloch during its transit through lakes, and partly explains the patterns in surface water pCO2 oversaturation that have been observed across gradients of lake size and volume. We estimate that in-lake DOCalloch mineralization could potentially contribute on average 30–40{\%} of the observed surface carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) across northern lakes. Applying the RC framework to in-lake DOCalloch dynamics improves our understanding of DOCalloch transformation and fate along the aquatic network, and results in a predictable mosaic of DOC reactivity and potential CO2 emissions across lakes within a landscape.},

abstract = {The present study was developed for the Patos Lagoon, a coastal lagoon located in southern Brazil. Due to operational limitations, most of water quality studies in Brazilian coastal lagoons are conducted through field sampling at specific stations, providing limited spatial and temporal resolution. Particularly in the Patos Lagoon, studies were conducted through sampling at specific stations at the northern area of the lagoon and/or focusing on its estuarine area. The lagoon has a major importance for the south of Brazil in both environmental and economic aspects, being subject to several human activities, which affect its water quality. Studies indicate that hydrological variations at different spatial scales could affect the Patos Lagoon dynamics, especially those variations resulting from El Ni??o and La Ni??a events, promoting wet and dry conditions, respectively. This work presents the spatial and temporal variability of chlorophyll-a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (ammonium, nitrate and phosphate) throughout the Patos Lagoon in two distinct situations: one typical of La Ni??a event (represented by the 2006 year), and the other, typical of El Ni??o event (represented by the 2011 year), in order to evaluated if the hydrological variability affects water quality variables throughout the system. Differences between the two situations are concentrated on the main physical forcing, the river flow discharge at the north of the system (Guaiba River) and wind magnitude, being both more intense in 2011 than in 2006. The study was conducted using the MOHID2D numerical model, since it overcomes the field and costs limitations. Results showed that the analyzed concentrations of the main variables were higher in wet condition (2011), with exception of phosphate. The spatial and temporal variations of all water quality variables, however, were similar in both conditions. Thus, different hydrological conditions could affect the magnitude of the concentration of the main water quality variables, but that does not affect significantly its spatial and temporal variability. In addition, it is evident that the numerical modeling application provides a systematic evaluation of a complex coastal system, as the Patos Lagoon, becoming an important tool for its environmental management.},

abstract = {Pigment-based growth rates of phytoplankton and mortality rates due to microzooplankton grazing were estimated using a dilution method combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment analysis in the northwestern North Pacific in autumn 1998. The dilution experiments were conducted at different hydrographic stations in both colder and warmer water masses. No significant difference was found between the growth rate of the phytoplankton community (0.38-0.70 day
                        -1; estimated by chlorophyll a) at the colder and warmer water stations, while the mortality rate (0.15-0.88 day
                        -1; estimated by chlorophyll a) tended to be higher at warmer water stations. The combination of estimates of daily chlorophyll a production and particulate organic carbon (POC) production enabled us to assess the carbon to chlorophyll a ratio (C/chl a) of "new" organic matter produced by living phytoplankton. The method provided an implicit value of the C/chl a of in situ living phytoplankton. The rate estimates from taxon-specific pigments suggested a possibility that chlorophyll b-containing green algae were grazed preferentially by microzooplankton during their active growth, and the standing stock of green algae was more strictly controlled by micrograzer than other algal groups such as diatoms. This result is one possible explanation for the fact that blooms of green algae have not been reported in the open ocean, in contrast with diatoms. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A large part of the world's inland waters, including streams, rivers, ponds, lakes and reservoirs is subject to occasional, recurrent or even permanent drying. Moreover, the occurrence and intensity of drying events are increasing in many areas of the world because of climate change, water abstraction, and land use alteration. Yet, information on the gaseous carbon (C) fluxes from dry inland waters is scarce, thus precluding a comprehensive assessment of C emissions including all, also intermittently dry, inland waters. Here, we review current knowledge on gaseous C fluxes from lotic (streams and rivers) and lentic (ponds, lakes, and reservoirs) inland waters during dry phases and the response to rewetting, considering controls and sources as well as implications of including ‘dry' fluxes for local and global scale estimates. Moreover, knowledge gaps and research needs are discussed. Our conservative estimates indicate that adding emissions from dry inland waters to current global estimates of CO2 emissions from inland waters could result in an increase of 0.22 Pg C year−1, or {\~{}}10{\%} of total fluxes. We outline the necessary conceptual understanding to successfully include dry phases in a more complete picture of inland water C emissions and identify potential implications for global C cycle feedbacks.},

abstract = {Current parameterization of several important physiological rates using rectangular hyperbolic saturation formulations is inadequate to capture our expanding understanding of the dynamic regulation of nutrients and energy at the primary producer level across all substrate levels, from limiting to super-saturating. Nutrient regulation by primary producers can affect chemical composition, in turn affecting predator–prey interactions and biogeochemical feedbacks in complex foodwebs. Anthropogenically altered nutrient loads are accentuating these challenges by altering nutrient stoichiometry. Using examples derived from the development of phytoplankton physiological dynamic regulation, the case is made that dynamic regulatory concepts are relevant at all levels of ecosystem regulation, that elemental stoichiometry must be considered in physiological, trophodynamic and biogeochemical constructs, and that the classical notion that nutrients and nutrient stoichiometry are only regulatory for physiology when at the limiting end of the spectrum must be laid to rest. Advancing models will require new emphasis on physiology including both dissipatory regulation and assimilatory regulation and the feed-back mechanisms between them.},

abstract = {Planktonic metabolism in a Mediterranean reservoir during a near-surface cyanobacterial bloom Summer blooms of large, filamentous, nitrogen-fixing and potentially toxic cyanobacteria are characteristic of many productive , warm monomictic reservoirs in the Mediterranean region, where they constitute stable assemblages. The accumulation of positively buoyant cyanobacteria at the surface layers of the water column favours-among others-the interception of light, inorganic carbon and nitrogen fluxes from the atmosphere, giving these prokaryotes a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton groups. Cyanobacterial blooms can cause deleterious effects to water quality and reservoir ecosystem services. Although the structure of the plankton community in reservoirs during cyanobacterial blooms is a well-known limnological issue, few studies have been undertaken on its functional characteristics. In this study, we used a high-resolution autonomous monitoring system to investigate the short-term changes in gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP) and community respiration (R) in the near-surface waters of a Mediterranean reservoir during a dense summer cyanobacterial bloom. Our results demonstrate that during the bloom, the surface waters of the reservoir showed a well-balanced planktonic metabolism, with a mean GPP:R ratio not significantly different than 1 and therefore close positive correlations between GPP and R. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the daily integrated incident light and the NEP:GPP ratio, while the mixed-layer depth and NEP:GPP ratio were negatively correlated, suggesting a central role for physical processes in the control of community metabolism and the persistence of the cyanobacterial bloom. The implications for the bloom stability and relevance for reservoir water quality management are noted.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Size spectra show common patterns of variation among ecosystem types, functional guilds and taxonomic groups, as well as predictable responses to pressures. Here, we extend the size spectra approach to macroinvertebrate ecological status assessment in transitional waters, by developing, testing and validating a multi-metric index of size spectra sensitivity (ISS), which integrates size structure metrics with metrics describing the sensitivity of size classes to anthropogenic disturbance and species richness measures. The ability of different theoretical models of size spectra sensitivity to discriminate between undisturbed and disturbed ecosystems and levels of environmental stress was evaluated. We have used data on benthic macroinvertebrates within 12 Mediterranean and Black Sea transitional water bodies (i.e. coastal lagoons) from Italy, Albania, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania and compared the models' efficiency through their pressure-impact response along organic load and enrichment gradients. Data from a thirteenth Mediterranean lagoon was used for validation purposes. Asymmetric models of size class sensitivity, assuming higher sensitivity of larger body size classes, were found to be more effective than symmetric models, with higher sensitivity of less common size classes, in distinguishing undisturbed from disturbed lagoons and lagoon stations. The ISS based on the asymmetric sensitivity model that was most efficient in identifying the anthropogenic impacts also showed significant dose-response relationships along environmental parameters describing the organic load and enrichment gradients. A scheme for the classification of Ecological Quality Status based on the macroinvertebrate ISS is proposed and validated. The validation procedure found that ISS is an effective and sensitive monitoring tool, easy to apply and to inter-calibrate among laboratories. Moreover, the tests performed here over a very large ecoregional area have proved the spatial robustness of the new index. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Rates of metabolism and population growth are often assumed to decrease universally with increasing organism size. Recent observations have shown, however, that maximum population growth rates among phytoplankton smaller than ∼6 $\mu$m in diameter tend to increase with organism size. Here we bring together observations and theory to demonstrate that the observed change in slope is attributable to a trade-off between nutrient uptake and the potential rate of internal metabolism. Specifically, we apply an established model of phytoplankton growth to explore a trade-off between the ability of cells to replenish their internal quota (which increases with size) and their ability to synthesize new biomass (which decreases with size). Contrary to the metabolic theory of ecology, these results demonstrate that rates of resource acquisition (rather than metabolism) provide the primary physiological constraint on the growth rates of some of the smallest and most numerically abundant photosynthetic organisms on Earth.},

abstract = {Bacterioplankton communities play a key role in aquatic carbon cycling, specifically with respect to the magnitude of organic carbon processed and partitioning of this carbon into biomass and respiratory losses. Studies of bacterioplankton carbon demand (BCD) and growth efficiency (BGE) frequently report higher values in more productive systems, suggesting these aspects of carbon metabolism may be positively coupled. However, the existence of such a relationship in natural aquatic systems has yet to be identified. Using a comprehensive 2-year study of bacterioplankton carbon metabolism in a temperate estuary, we investigated BCD and BGE and explored factors that may modulate their magnitude and coherence, including nutrient concentrations, dissolved nutrient uptake and source and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). During the course of our study, BCD ranged from 0.4 to 15.9 mu g l(-1) h(-1), with an overall mean of 3.8 mu g l(-1) h(-1). Mean BGE was similar to that reported for other estuarine systems (0.32) and of comparable range (that is, 0.06 - 0.68). Initial analyses identified a negative correlation between BCD and BGE, yet removal of the effect of temperature revealed an underlying positive coupling that was also correlated with long-term DOC lability. Whereas BCD was weakly related to ambient DOC concentrations, neither BCD nor BGE showed any relationship with ambient nutrient concentrations or nutrient uptake stoichiometries. We conclude that in this carbon-rich estuary, organic matter source and quality play an important role in regulating the magnitude of carbon metabolism and may be more important than nutrient availability alone in the regulation of BGE.},

abstract = {The purpose of this review is to highlight progress in unraveling carbon cycling dynamics across the continuum of landscapes, inland waters, coastal oceans, and the atmosphere. Earth systems are intimately interconnected, yet most biogeochemical studies focus on specific components in isolation. The movement of water drives the carbon cycle, and, as such, inland waters provide a critical intersection between terrestrial and marine biospheres. Inland, estuarine, and coastal waters are well studied in regions near centers of human population in the Northern hemisphere. However, many of the world's large river systems and their marine receiving waters remain poorly characterized, particularly in the tropics, which contribute to a disproportionately large fraction of the transformation of terrestrial organic matter to carbon dioxide, and the Arctic, where positive feedback mechanisms are likely to amplify global climate change. There are large gaps in current coverage of environmental observations along the aquatic continuum. For example, tidally-influenced reaches of major rivers and near-shore coastal regions around river plumes are often left out of carbon budgets due to a combination of methodological constraints and poor data coverage. We suggest that closing these gaps could potentially alter global estimates of CO2 outgassing from surface waters to the atmosphere by several-fold. Finally, in order to identify and constrain/embrace uncertainties in global carbon budget estimations it is important that we further adopt statistical and modeling approaches that have become well-established in the fields of oceanography and paleoclimatology, for example.},

abstract = {Bacterioplankton respiration (BR) may represent the largest single sink of organic carbon in the biosphere and constitutes an important driver of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from freshwaters. Complete understanding of BR is precluded by the fact that most studies need to assume a respiratory quotient (RQ; mole of CO(2) produced per mole of O(2) consumed) to calculate rates of BR. Many studies have, without clear support, assumed a fixed RQ around 1. Here we present 72 direct measurements of bacterioplankton RQ that we carried out in epilimnetic samples of 52 freshwater sites in Qu{\'{e}}bec (Canada), using O(2) and CO(2) optic sensors. The RQs tended to converge around 1.2, but showed large variability (s.d.=0.45) and significant correlations with major gradients of ecosystem-level, substrate-level and bacterial community-level characteristics. Experiments with natural bacterioplankton using different single substrates suggested that RQ is intimately linked to the elemental composition of the respired compounds. RQs were on average low in net autotrophic systems, where bacteria likely were utilizing mainly reduced substrates, whereas we found evidence that the dominance of highly oxidized substrates, for example, organic acids formed by photo-chemical processes, led to high RQ in the more heterotrophic systems. Further, we suggest that BR contributes to a substantially larger share of freshwater CO(2) emissions than presently believed based on the assumption that RQ is ∼1. Our study demonstrates that bacterioplankton RQ is not only a practical aspect of BR determination, but also a major ecosystem state variable that provides unique information about aquatic ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Methane emissions from lakes and reservoirs are a major natural source in the global budget of atmospheric CH4. A large fraction of these emissions are due to diffusive transport of CH4 from surface waters to the atmosphere. It was suggested recently that CH4 production in the oxic surface waters is required to compensate for diffusive CH4 emissions from lakes. In contrast, we demonstrate here that typical diffusive CH4-fluxes from sediments in shallow water zones, Fsed,S, suffice to explain CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. Our analysis is based on the combination of an exceptional data set on surface concentrations of CH4 with a mass balance model of CH4 that is focused on the surface mixed layer and considers CH4-fluxes from sediments, lateral transport, gas exchange with the atmosphere, and includes temperature dependencies of sediment fluxes and gas exchange. Fsed,S not only explains observed surface CH4 concentrations but also concentration differences between shallow and open water zones, and the seasonal variability of emissions and lateral concentration distributions. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that diffusive fluxes from shallow sediments and not oxic methanogenesis are the main source of the CH4 in the surface waters and the CH4 emitted from lakes and reservoirs.},

We assembled the largest global dataset to date on emission rates of all three GHGs and found they covary with lake size and trophic state. Fitted models were upscaled to estimate global emission using global lake size inventories and a remotely sensed global lake productivity distribution. Traditional upscaling approaches overestimated CO2 and N2O emission but underestimated CH4 by half. Our upscaled size-productivity weighted estimates (1.25–2.30 Pg of CO2-equivalents annually) are nearly 20{\%} of global CO2 fossil fuel emission with ∼ 75{\%} of the climate impact due to CH4. Moderate global increases in eutrophication could translate to 5–40{\%} increases in the GHG effects in the atmosphere, adding the equivalent effect of another 13{\%} of fossil fuel combustion or an effect equal to GHG emissions from current land use change.},

@article{McGinnis2006,
abstract = {There is growing concern about the transfer of methane originating from water bodies to the atmosphere. Methane from sediments can reach the atmosphere directly via bubbles or indirectly via vertical turbulent transport. This work quantifies methane gas bubble dissolution using a combination of bubble modeling and acoustic observations of rising bubbles to determine what fraction of the methane transported by bubbles will reach the atmosphere. The bubble model predicts the evolving bubble size, gas composition, and rise distance and is suitable for almost all aquatic environments. The model was validated using methane and argon bubble dissolution measurements obtained from the literature for deep, oxic, saline water with excellent results. Methane bubbles from within the hydrate stability zone (typically below ∼500 m water depth in the ocean) are believed to form an outer hydrate rim. To explain the subsequent slow dissolution, a model calibration was performed using bubble dissolution data from the literature measured within the hydrate stability zone. The calibrated model explains the impressively tall flares ({\textgreater}1300 m) observed in the hydrate stability zone of the Black Sea. This study suggests that only a small amount of methane reaches the surface at active seep sites in the Black Sea, and this only from very shallow water areas ({\textless}100 m). Clearly, the Black Sea and the ocean are rather effective barriers against the transfer of bubble methane to the atmosphere, although substantial amounts of methane may reach the surface in shallow lakes and reservoirs.

@article{Abril2015,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Inland waters have been recognized as a significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere at the global scale. Fluxes of CO2 between aquatic systems and the atmosphere are calculated from the gas transfer velocity and the water–air gradient of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). Currently, direct measurements of water pCO2 remain scarce in freshwaters, and most published pCO2 data are calculated from temperature, pH and total alkalinity (TA). Here, we compare calculated (pH and TA) and measured (equilibrator and headspace) water pCO2 in a large array of temperate and tropical freshwaters. The 761 data points cover a wide range of values for TA (0 to 14 200 $\mu$mol L−1), pH (3.94 to 9.17), measured pCO2 (36 to 23 000 ppmv), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (29 to 3970 $\mu$mol L−1). Calculated pCO2 were {\textgreater}10{\%} higher than measured pCO2 in 60{\%} of the samples (with a median overestimation of calculated pCO2 compared to measured pCO2 of 2560 ppmv) and were {\textgreater}100{\%} higher in the 25{\%} most organic-rich and acidic samples (with a median overestimation of 9080 ppmv). We suggest these large overestimations of calculated pCO2 with respect to measured pCO2 are due to the combination of two cumulative effects: (1) a more significant contribution of organic acids anions to TA in waters with low carbonate alkalinity and high DOC concentrations; (2) a lower buffering capacity of the carbonate system at low pH, which increases the sensitivity of calculated pCO2 to TA in acidic and organic-rich waters. No empirical relationship could be derived from our data set in order to correct calculated pCO2 for this bias. Owing to the widespread distribution of acidic, organic-rich freshwaters, we conclude that regional and global estimates of CO2 outgassing from freshwaters based on pH and TA data only are most likely overestimated, although the magnitude of the overestimation needs further quantitative analysis. Direct measurements of pCO2 are recommended in inland waters in general, and in particular in acidic, poorly buffered freshwaters.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Reservoirs represent a key component of the global carbon cycle. However, estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from reservoirs remain poorly constrained due to the absence of spatially and temporally resolved measurements. We performed high-resolution monitoring of CO2 emissions (FCO2) in a semiarid hard-water reservoir to examine its seasonal and diel variability. Our results suggest that dissolved inorganic carbon input plays a central role in sustaining the surface water CO2 partial pressure (pCO2), which varies from 1076 to 4587 $\mu$atm. Although the reservoir is moderately to highly productive throughout the year, it is a net CO2 source with FCO2 values in the range of 308–1753 mg C m−2 d–1. This high CO2 efflux indicates that productive waters are not necessarily CO2 sinks. Both pCO2 and FCO2 exhibit clear seasonal and diel patterns. Surface water pCO2 is highest in March and presents a consistent diurnal/nocturnal pattern with the daytime pCO2 6–13{\%} lower than the nighttime pCO2. High CO2 efflux is observed during the ice-thaw period, indicating the release of CO2 that was accumulated during the winter. CO2 effluxes are typically higher during the nighttime driven by aquatic metabolism, but episodic weather events (e.g., rainfall and strong winds) can significantly enhance CO2 emissions and even reverse the diel pattern. Our study also shows that using only daytime measurements to estimate daily CO2 emissions would underestimate it by 9–25{\%}. Hence, future global assessments should incorporate CO2 emissions from hard-water reservoirs and account for their seasonal and diel variability.},

abstract = {Monomictic reservoirs and lakes undergo to a thermally stratified period during the year. Summer-autumn stratification in monomictic reservoirs isolates bottom waters (hypolimnion) from upper layers (epilimnion) and surface. During this period, hypolimnion would become anoxic and restrict aerobic processes, therefore, changing ecosystem metabolic paths and rates and altering carbon fluxes. Hydrological and temperature changes associated to global warming are expected to alter the extent and volume of the anoxic hypolimnetic layer. To understand how aerobic or anaerobic metabolic processes change throughout the stratified period is needed to evaluate how future hydrological changes affect the carbon balance in these ecosystems. In this study, we measured aerobic primary production (GPP) and community respiration (ER) rates during the stratified period in the whole water column of a warm monomictic reservoir located in South Spain. High-frequency data recorded from a moored automatic monitoring station were used to estimate aerobic respiration and primary production through the ‘diel oxygen technique'. The monitoring platform was fitted with a meteorological station and a set of limnological probes performing vertical profiles (1 m depth resolution) of many physico-chemical variables (i.e. water temperature, PAR radiation, dissolved oxygen concentration, conductivity and chlorophyll a concentration) on a 4 hours frequency. Results demonstrated a net autotrophic epilimnion, with GPP and ER mean rates of 47.3 (±18.3) and 10.9 (±13.8) mmol O 2 m -3 day -1 , respectively. However, metalimnion depicted balanced ER and GPP rates, 15.4 (±20.6) and 16.9 (±19.2) mmol O 2 m -3 day -1 , respectively, with net ecosystem production (NEP=GPP-ER) close to 0. A negative relationship between epilimnetic ER and hypolimnetic ER suggests an increase of organic matter respiration in the reservoir upper layers throughout the stratification period.},

We found that the gas transfer velocity scales with the product of stream slope and velocity, which is in alignment with theory on stream energy dissipation.

abstract = {Microbial activity is a fundamental component of oceanic nutrient cycles. Photosynthetic microbes, collectively termed phytoplankton, are responsible for the vast majority of primary production in marine waters. The availability of nutrients in the upper ocean frequently limits the activity and abundance of these organisms. Experimental data have revealed two broad regimes of phytoplankton nutrient limitation in the modern upper ocean. Nitrogen availability tends to limit productivity throughout much of the surface low-latitude ocean, where the supply of nutrients from the subsurface is relatively slow. In contrast, iron often limits productivity where subsurface nutrient supply is enhanced, including within the main oceanic upwelling regions of the Southern Ocean and the eastern equatorial Pacific. Phosphorus, vitamins and micronutrients other than iron may also (co-)limit marine phytoplankton. The spatial patterns and importance of co-limitation, however, remain unclear. Variability in the stoichiometries of nutrient supply and biological demand are key determinants of oceanic nutrient limitation. Deciphering the mechanisms that underpin this variability, and the consequences for marine microbes, will be a challenge. But such knowledge will be crucial for accurately predicting the consequences of ongoing anthropogenic perturbations to oceanic nutrient biogeochemistry.},

abstract = {Despite the increasing understanding of the magnitude and drivers of carbon gas emissions from inland waters, the relevance of water fluctuation and associated drying on their dynamics is rarely addressed. Here, we quantified CO2 and CH4 fluxes from a set of temporary ponds across seasons. The ponds were in all occasion net CO2 emitters irrespective of the presence or absence of water. While the CO2 fluxes were in the upper range of emissions for freshwater lentic systems, CH4 fluxes were mostly undetectable. Dry habitats substantially contributed to these emissions and were always a source of CO2, whereas inundated habitats acted either as a source or a sink of atmospheric CO2 along the year. Higher concentrations of coloured and humic organic matter in water and sediment were linked to higher CO2 emissions. Composition of the sediment microbial community was related both to dissolved organic matter concentration and composition, but we did not find a direct link with CO2 fluxes. The presence of methanogenic archaea in most ponds suggested the potential for episodic CH4 production and emission. Our results highlight the need for spatially and temporally inclusive approaches that consider the dry phases and habitats to characterize carbon cycling in temporary systems.},

abstract = {The influence of nutrient addition on the growth and microzooplankton grazing rates of individual phytoplankton groups was investigated in a mesocosm experiment including nutrient manipulation and using the dilution technique. The nutrient addition caused phytoplankton biomass to increase; chlorophyll a was less than 3.5 {\$}\mu{\$}g l-1 in the control enclosure, while chlorophyll a increased to 19 and 35 {\$}\mu{\$}g l-1 in enclosures added nitrogen and phosphate (NP) and nitrogen, phosphate and silicate (NPSi), respectively. The growth and grazing rates were highly variable during the experimental period and the grazing rates were significantly correlated to the growth rates. Diatoms, prymnesiophytes, and dinoflagellates occasionally reached very high growth rates, up to 2.8 d-1. The phytoplankton in the NPSi enclosure consisted mostly of diatoms, which proved unsuitable for incubation, since they formed aggregates in the incubation bottles, and the dilution experiments carried out in this enclosure were consequently not successful. The addition of nutrients (N, P, Si, Mn, and Fe) to the dilution experiment caused an increase in the growth rates of the phytoplankton both in the control and the NP enclosures. In both the control and NP enclosures, the growth rates of the diatoms increased significantly owing to nutrient addition.},

abstract = {Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion has been recognized as a problem in the central basin of Lake Erie since the 1970s. However, recent expansion in distribution of the depletion after several years of low depletion rates in the 1990s has led investigators to explore the factors that influence the extent of the depletion. We have investigated the vertical oxygen budget in the central basin, which is influenced by the following factors: 1) vertical mixing; 2) exchange across the air-water interface; 3) photosynthesis; 4) respiration of plankton; and 5) sediment oxygen demand. We tested the importance of these factors using a 1-D vertical oxygen budget and transport simulations through sensitivity analysis and by estimating vertical mixing parameters using a temperature gradient microprofiler. Epilimnetic factors were found to be robust and the present monitoring efforts are sufficient; while epilimnetic production is ultimately the source of the hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, epilimnetic factors do not directly influence on hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. However, hypolimnetic depletion was sensitive to sediment oxygen demand and hypolimnion respiration, which are the results of primary production in the epilimnion, and hypolimnetic mixing, which is not related to eutrophication. These parameters, especially the physical mixing measurements, and their links with eutrophication and primary production require greater monitoring and analysis because of their influence on the expansion of oxygen depletion in the central basin of Lake Erie.},

abstract = {Aeration with the commercially available LIMNO aerator has now been in use for about 10 years. Over 40 aerator units have been installed and successfully operated in nine different projects. From the abundant experience gathered during this relatively long period some examples are chosen to illustrate the efforts on increased mineralization capacity of allochthonous and autochthonous organic material. The ubiquitous eutrophication problems especially degrade water quality in lakes and reservoirs. Excessively produced algal material in the hypolimnetic layer leads to serious anoxia, preventing higher life and aerobic respiration processes. Furthermore, internal recycling processes connected with the metabolic and geochemical cycles of manganese and iron enable the multiple use of recycled phosphorus. All of these processes are possible to control by aeration. On the other hand, necessary treatment for drinking water preparation, such as filtration, flocculation, and chlorination can be reduced if a sufficient oxygen balance is maintained in the hypolimnetic water body. Results are presented from two drinking water reservoirs and some lakes where drastic improvements were observed. {\textcopyright} 1984 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {An active debate has been underway on the magnitude and duration of carbon (C) emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs, yet little attention has been paid to stochastic C emissions from reservoir sediments during extreme climatic events. A rare opportunity for field measurements of CO2 efflux from a hydroelectric reservoir in Korea during an extreme drought event was used to examine how prolonged droughts can affect microbial organic matter processing and the release of CO2, CH4 and N2O from exposed sediments. Chamber measurements of CO2 efflux along an exposed sediment transect, combined with high-frequency continuous sensor measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the reservoir surface water, exhibited extraordinary pulses of CO2 from exposed sediments and the turbulent inflowing water in contrast to a small CO2 sink in the main water body of the reservoir and a low efflux of CO2 from the flooded sediment. Significant increases in the production of CO2, CH4 and N2O observed in a laboratory incubation of sediments, together with enhanced activities of phenol oxidase and three hydrolases, indicate a temporary activation of microbial organic matter processing in the drying sediment. The results suggest that drought-triggered pulses of greenhouse gas emission from exposed sediments can offset the C accumulation in reservoir sediments over time scales of years to decades, reversing the trend of declining C emissions from aging reservoirs.},

In this model, predation is the single process governing the energy flow in the ecosystem, as it causes both growth and mortality. The ratio of predator to prey is assumed to be distributed: predators may feed on a range of prey sizes. Under these assumptions, it is shown that linear size spectra are stationary solutions of the model. Exploited fish communities are simulated by adding fishing mortality to the model: it is found that realistic fishing should affect the curvature and stability of the size spectrum rather than its slope.},

A relation between the frequency distribution of size of the parti- cles found in the digestive tract of the animals and the frequency distribution of size of the parti- cles found in the medium is shown. The results indicate that Artemia has a preference for food of specific size. The behavior of different size-classes of animals analyzed is shown, but I conclude the size of food for Artemia must range between 6.8 and 27.5 gm, with the optimum about 16.0 gm.},

Our results highlight several important aspects: a shift in the annual peak density from the summer-autumn season, observed in 1999-2002, to the winter-spring season in subsequent years; simultaneous reductions in chlorophyll a concentrations and cell size from 1999 to 2008; and the modification of the structure of the phytoplankton assemblages, from a more differentiated class composition in 1999-2002 to the subsequent dominance of the Cyanophyceae. Moreover, analysis of similarity on both abiotic and phytoplanktonic data shows significant differences among the hydrological years considered. Pearson's correlations indicate temperature, salinity and nutrients as the environmental parameters that most influenced the phytoplankton composition and dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Reservoirs are a globally significant source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, emission rate estimates may be biased low due to inadequate monitoring during brief periods of elevated emission rates (that is, hot moments). Here we investigate CH4 bubbling (that is, ebullition) during periods of falling water levels in a eutrophic reservoir in the Midwestern USA. We hypothesized that periods of water-level decline trigger the release of CH4-rich bubbles from the sediments and that these emissions constitute a substantial fraction of the annual CH4 flux. We explored this hypothesis by monitoring CH4 ebullition in a eutrophic reservoir over a 7-month period, which included an experimental water-level drawdown. We found that the ebullitive CH4 flux rate was among the highest ever reported for a reservoir (mean = 32.3 mg CH4 m−2 h−1). The already high ebullitive flux rates increased by factors of 1.4–77 across the nine monitoring sites during the 24-h experimental water-level drawdown, but these emissions constituted only 3{\%} of the CH4 flux during the 7-month monitoring period due to the naturally high ebullitive CH4 flux rates that persist throughout the warm weather season. Although drawdown emissions were found to be a minor component of annual CH4 emissions in this reservoir, our findings demonstrate a link between water-level change and CH4 ebullition, suggesting that CH4 emissions may be mitigated through water-level management in some reservoirs.},

@article{Hammer2005,
abstract = {Mixotrophy (=heterotrophy and photosynthesis by a single individual) is a common phenomenon in aquatic ecosystems, in particular under light- or nutrient-limitation. However, it is not usually considered in mathematical models of biological populations. This paper shows how different types of mixotrophy might be usefully incorporated into a general predator-prey model, and explores the consequences for plankton bloom dynamics and productivity. It is demonstrated, analytically and numerically, that even small levels of type III mixotrophy (a small fraction of the zooplankton also being involved in primary production) have significant effects on a system's equilibrium structure, stability, and short-term dynamics. Type III mixotrophy has a stabilizing effect on the system by reducing its excitability, i.e. its propensity to exhibit blooms. Compared with the non-mixotrophic benchmark, for a phytoplankton bloom to be triggered in a system with type III mixotrophy, a much larger perturbation is necessary. Type II mixotrophy (a small fraction of algae engage in phagotrophy) and type I mixotrophy (equal phagotrophy and phototrophy) are briefly discussed. The potential consequences for productivity are also studied. Our results indicate that the phytoplankton-zooplankton system becomes more productive in the presence of type III mixotrophy. ?? 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas, and it has been estimated that 50{\%} of annual CH4 comes from terrestrial systems. Better and more accurate methods are needed to quantify CH4 flux from terrestrial environments. Two general methods commonly applied to measure trace gas fluxes are soil cover (chamber) techniques, and micrometeorology methods. Both of these methods has advantages and disadvantages, yet little information is available concerning the relative performance of the techniques. This study was conducted to compare CH4 flux measurements obtained by using a closed-chamber soil cover technique and a micrometeorological method (Bowen-ratio Energy Balance [BREB]). Methane flux rates obtained by both methods were compared using nine time points over 3 d at a peatland site in north central Minnesota. Mean CH4 fluxes obtained by both methods were of the same magnitude (2.43-5.88 mg CH4 m-2 h-1); however, differences were observed in the magnitudes of temporal variability as well as the detection sensitivities (minimum detectable flux). The minimum detectable flux for the closed-chamber method was 9.32×10-2 mg CH4 m-2 h-1, while the minimum detectable flux for the BREB method ranged from 2.16 to 25.5 mg CH4 m-2 h-1. Due to analytical uncertainties associated with gas chromatographic determination of CH4 gradients, the BREB is not recommended.},

@article{Samiotis2018,
abstract = {Water reservoirs are used for many purposes, such as water supply, irrigation, flood mitigation, and hydroelectric energy generation. Although hydroelectric energy is considered “green,” many studies show that the construction of a reservoir enhances greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the transformed area. These emissions, mainly of CO2, CH4, and N2O gases, depend on the age of the reservoir, landscape and soil composition, fauna and flora remnants of the impounded area, climatic conditions, and basin runoffs. Consequently, GHG emissions significantly vary between reservoirs and depending on local specificities. Several studies have investigated GHG emissions from reservoirs around the world, focusing mainly on reservoirs located in cold regions, temperate regions, and tropical regions. Research is lacking for reservoirs in Mediterranean countries, like Greece, and similar regions. This work initially assesses the net GHG emissions of a newly created reservoir (Ilarion est. 2012) in Western Macedonia, Greece. The methodology for net GHG emission calculation was based on the use of literature data concerning pre-impoundment emission factors and local specificities of the reservoir (terrain type, canopy cover), as well as on the 2-year measurement data that were collected using a “static floating chamber.” Furthermore, in this work, the gross GHG emissions of an older, in-line reservoir (Polyfytos est. 1974) were also calculated, based on 2-year measurement data. The results show that the global warming potential (GWP) of the reservoirs is dictated by methane emissions; it minimizes during winter and spring and maximizes during summer and autumn. Hydroelectric energy production at Ilarion Reservoir results in 32 to 97 times less total CO2 equivalent emissions in comparison to fossil fuels, while at Polyfytos Reservoir only 8 to 24 times less (based on gross emissions). It appears that the impact of a reservoir's morphology on GHG emissions is more significant than that of a reservoir's age.},

abstract = {Understanding of the processes that control CO2 concentrations in the aquatic environment has been hampered by the absence of a direct method to make continuous measurements over both short- and long-term time intervals. We describe an in situ method in which a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor is enclosed in a water impermeable, gas permeable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane and deployed in a freshwater environment. This allows measurements of CO2 concentration to be made directly at a specific depth in the water column without the need for pumps or reagents. We demonstrate the potential of the method using examples from different aquatic environments characterized by a range of CO2 concentrations (0 5-8 0mg CO2-C l-1), equivalent to ca 40-650 $\mu$mol CO2 l-1). These comprise streams and ponds from tropical, temperate and boreal regions. Data derived from the sensor was compared with direct measurements of CO2 concentrations using headspace analysis. Sensor performance following long-term ({\textgreater}6 months) field deployment conformed to manufacturers' specifications, with no drift detected. We conclude that the sensor-based method is a robust, accurate and responsive method, with a wide range of potential applications, particularly when combined with other in situ sensor-based measurements of related variables. {\textcopyright} 2009 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Globally, reservoirs are a significant source of atmospheric CO2. However, precise quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from drinking water reservoirs on the regional or national scale is still challenging. We calculated CO2 fluxes for 39 German drinking water reservoirs during a period of 22 years (1991–2013) using routine monitoring data in order to quantify total emission of CO2 from drinking water reservoirs in Germany and to identify major drivers. All reservoirs were a net CO2 source with a median flux of 167 g C m− 2 y− 1, which makes gaseous emissions a relevant process for the carbon budget of each reservoir. Fluxes varied seasonally with median fluxes of 13, 48, and 201 g C m− 2 y− 1 in spring, summer, and autumn respectively. Differences between reservoirs appeared to be primarily caused by the concentration of CO2 in the surface water rather than by the physical gas transfer coefficient. Consideration of short term fluctuations of the gas transfer coefficient due to varying wind speed had only a minor effect on the annual budgets. High CO2 emissions only occurred in reservoirs with pH {\textless} 7 and total alkalinity {\textless} 0.2 mEq l− 1. Annual CO2 emissions correlated exponentially with pH but not with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). There was significant correlation between land use in the catchment and CO2 emissions. In total, German drinking water reservoirs emit 44000 t of CO2 annually, which makes them a negligible CO2 source ({\textless} 0.005{\%} of national CO2 emissions) in Germany.},

The scaling relationship between cellular chlorophyll a content and cell size is also isometric. Taxonomical changes along the size spectrum may explain the deviation of phytoplankton photosynthesis from the general allometric rule. The size scaling exponent for photosynthesis is significantly higher (1.14) in coastal productive waters than in the oligotrophic open ocean (0.96), which provides a physiological basis to explain the dominance of larger cells in nutrient-rich environments. The size scaling exponent for phytoplankton abundance is significantly less negative in coastal productive waters (-0.90) than in the oligotrophic open ocean (-1.25). The observed size scaling relationships imply that carbon fixation per unit volume decreases with cell size in oligotrophic waters, whereas the opposite occurs in productive ones. By controlling the metabolism–size scaling relationship, nutrient supply plays a major role in determining community size structure and the energy flow through the pelagic ecosystem.},

Except in coastal waters the predominant organisms of the upper 500 m in the western North Atlantic and Southeast Pacific were generally $\mu$ flagellates (2–10 $\mu$). Most bacteria and many flagellates were associated with flocculent organic aggregates. Below 25–50 m most of the flagellates were non-pigmented.

abstract = {The ciliate Euplotes vannus is a common protozoan in mass cultures of rotifers, and rapid reproduction of E. vannus occasionally reduces the rotifer yield. We performed a competition experiment between the rotifer Brachionus rotundiformis and the ciliate E. vannus. The ciliate was inoculated at three stages of the rotifer growth curve: the lag phase, the logarithmic growth phase and the stationary phase. When feeding on the alga Tetraselmis tetrathele, the ciliate increased and the rotifer growth was suppressed. The interference with rotifer growth was stronger in the lag and stationary phases than in the logarithmic growth phase. In contrast, when feeding on the alga Nannochloropsis oculata, the ciliate did not increase and the rotifer growth was similar to the control. In addition to the competition experiments, 15N incorporation experiments were performed on the ciliate to investigate its food preference. The nitrogen incorporation rates ({\%} of body nitrogen h -1) of the ciliate were 0.7{\%} through dead algae and 1.9{\%} through rotifer feces when using T. tetrathele, and 0.4{\%} through dead algae and 3.4{\%} through rotifer feces when using N. oculata. The incorporation rate through bacteria-free rotifer feces was about one-third that of normal rotifer feces. These results indicated that the ciliate did not incorporate algal nitrogen directly, but rather through the microbial food chain, from phytoplankton to rotifer feces to bacteria. E. vannus incorporated the nitrogen of N. oculata and grew for a short time but the growth was soon suppressed. This growth inhibition may be due to allelopathy of N. oculata for E. vannus. Consequently, we propose that periodic addition of N. oculata should control E. vannus, and that this technique of applying allelopathy should be more sustainable than conventional treatments. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Mara{\~{n}}{\'{o}}n et al (2012) compiled a dataset of concurrent temperature and resource level proxies that they claim disentangled the effect of temperature from that of resource supply. They concluded that the hypothesis that temperature per se plays a direct role in controlling phytoplankton size structure should be rejected.

Although we obviously concur with Mara{\~{n}}{\'{o}}n et al (2012) in the long-known predominance of small phytoplankton cells under oligotrophic conditions, from our point of view this should not deter us from considering temperature as an important explanatory variable at a global scale since we show that, for the vast oligotrophic areas of the world's oceans where chlorophyll concentrations are below {\textless}1 $\mu$g L-1 temperature explains a high proportion of the variability in the size distribution of phytoplankton communities, a variability that can not be explained on the basis of the resource level proxies advocated by Mara{\~{n}}{\'{o}}n et al.

Salgados is a hypereutrophic intermittently open coastal lagoon, which received freshwater inputs from small rivers and from a wastewater treatment plant.Cyanophyceae dominated the phytoplankton communities most of the time; Bacillariophyceae became the main taxonomic group in winter when the lagoon was closed; Chlorophyceae was the major class in early summer; pico-nano flagellate algae accounted for a high percentage of total phytoplankton during spring. Potentially harmful taxa were observed during most of the sampling periods, forming blooms and accounting for a considerable percentage of total phytoplankton abundance. A strong differentiation among dry and wet seasons could be noticed. The dry season was dominated by Microsystis aeruginosa, Rhodomonas sp., pico-nano flagellate algae, Cyclotella spp. and Planktothrix sp., while the wet season, although still with the presence of Microsystis aeruginosa, was dominated by Dolichospermum spiroides. The best environmental variables explaining stations patterns and based on phytoplankton taxa were days of isolation, pH, and salinity. Temperature, cumulative rain and total phosphorus were also related with species and stations patterns. The high nutrient load in Salgados lagoon promoted the development and persistence of harmful algae blooms. Proper management of coastal lagoons involves not only the control of direct discharges of nutrients, but also of other factors, including water level and communication with the sea.},

abstract = {The bacterial biomass is an essential point in microbial ecology. The dry weight and carbon con? tent of microorganisms are traditionally used for the calculation of the fluxes of carbon and energy in aquatic ecosystems. Since direct measurements of these parameters in natural conditions are rather difficult, a certain biomass–carbon converting factor is used, which is determined experimentally or by empirical calculations. However, the relationship between the cell volume and its dry weight (in particular, carbon) does not depend only on the cell size and the conditions of its growth but also on the fixation and staining methods used. We made an attempt to summarize all the present data on the relationships between the cell volume, its dry weight, and the carbon content. Thus, the principal goal of the present study was searching for a generally applicable or methodology?dependent converting factor for the bacterial biomass calculation. Thereto, all the data available were grouped according to the dye used, as well as to the methods of fixation and the dry weight determination. The data on the most frequent combinations of dies and fixatives are insufficient for precise calculations; therefore, we suggest a relationship generalized for different methods of carbon and cell volume recalculations and applicable for bacterial cells larger than 0.025 µm3, as fgC cell–1 = 133.754 × V0.438.},

abstract = {Lakes and reservoirs globally are experiencing unprecedented changes in land use and climate, depleting dissolved oxygen (DO) in the bottom waters (hypolimnia) of these ecosystems. Because DO is the most energetically favorable terminal electron acceptor (TEA) for organic carbon mineralization, its availability controls the onset of alternate TEA pathways (for example, denitrification, manganese reduction, iron reduction, sulfate reduction, methanogenesis). Low DO concentrations can trigger organic carbon mineralization via alternate TEA pathways in the water column and sediments, which has important implications for greenhouse gas production [carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)]. In this study, we experimentally injected supersaturated DO into the hypolimnion of a eutrophic reservoir and measured concentrations of TEAs and terminal electron products (TEPs) in the experimental reservoir and an upstream reference reservoir. We calculated the electron equivalents yielded from each TEA pathway and estimated the contributions of each TEA pathway to organic carbon processing in both reservoirs. DO additions to the hypolimnion of the experimental reservoir promoted aerobic respiration, suppressing most alternate TEA pathways and resulting in elevated CO2 accumulation. In comparison, organic carbon mineralization in the reference reservoir's anoxic hypolimnion was dominated by alternate TEA pathways, resulting in both CH4 and CO2 accumulation. Our ecosystem-scale experiments demonstrate that the alternate TEA pathways that succeed aerobic respiration in lakes and reservoirs can be manipulated at the ecosystem scale. Moreover, changes in the DO dynamics of freshwater lakes and reservoirs may result in concomitant changes in the redox reactions in the water column that control organic carbon mineralization and greenhouse gas accumulation.},

abstract = {Changes in meteorological patterns to drier conditions alter the hydrodynamic processes of reservoirs and can affect their thermal structure. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of a severe drought period on the hydrodynamics of a tropical reservoir. One-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling was applied from 2009 to 2016 to simulate the thermal dynamics of the highly drought-impacted Serra Azul reservoir, a drinking water supply reservoir located in southeast Brazil. After calibration (r = 0.91, root mean square error [RMSE] = 1.33 °C) and validation of the model (r = 0.87, RMSE = 2.06 °C), physical indicators were calculated to evaluate the stratification and mixing processes in the water column. Results showed that the reservoir hydrodynamics were affected by the drought period through an increase in mixing frequency and duration. Negative implications for water quality are expected, such as higher concentration of dissolved substances and nutrients and increased turbidity, salinity, and electrical conductivity, as observed in most lakes and reservoirs subjected to drought. Different water withdrawal scenarios were simulated, and a critical water withdrawal volume that could prevent drought impacts on the Serra Azul reservoir thermal regime was identified. This study indicates the need for managers to understand potential impacts of extreme meteorological events in reservoir dynamics, particularly when the reservoirs are part of drinking water systems.},

NH4+ accumulated in the hypolimnion throughout the period of stratification and provided an overall measure of organic matter mineralization. Anaerobic metabolism, particularly methanogenesis, predominated because anoxia was total within less than 2 mo of spring water column turnover and nitrogen oxides were always completely depleted before fall turnover. The time of onset and rate of NO3- depletion varied considerably between years and were not always directly correlated with O2 concentration. It was estimated that, on average, O2 consumption, denitrification, and methanogenesis accounted for approximately 80{\%} of hypolimnetic organic C mineralization in the periods surveyed. -Authors},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) dynamics within the hypolimnion of a thermally stratified reservoir were examined to test an in situ approach to measuring dinitrogen (N2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) production rates wherein hypolimnion gas accumulation is used to estimate N2 and N2O production. This previously unpublished approach provides a spatially integrated, time-varying record of N transformation rates that fall well within the range of rates reported for other reservoir systems using other methods. Hypolimnion N2 production averaged 183 mmol N2-N m-2 h-1 with higher rates observed early in a spring stratification event (538 $\mu$mol N2-N m-2 h-1) and lower rates observed later in the same stratification event (90 mmol N2-N m22 h21). Sediment incubation experiments and hypolimnion nitrate (NO3-) data show that, over the course of the summer, progressive NO{\{}3 depletion at the sediment-water interface limited N2 production and associated N removal. As rates of N2 production dropped off, rates of N2O production increased (from 4.62 mmol N2O-N m-2 d-1 to 51 mmol N2O-N m-2 d-1, averaging 26 mmol N2O-N m-2 d-1), resulting in significant increases in N2O-N:N2-N ratios as the summer progressed. Also, whereas N2 production appeared to occur predominantly at the sediment-water interface, N2O production was detected throughout the water column, suggesting a role for nitrification as a source of N2O. The use of hypolimnion accumulation to quantify N transformation rates can thus offer new insights into spatial and seasonal N transformation patterns in stratified or otherwise capped aquatic systems.{\textcopyright} 2011, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.}},

Because this is so intimately related to oxidation, the notion tenaciously persists that where oxygen is absent, DOM turnover is markedly slowed. In this Opinion Piece, we outline how diverse processes shape, transform and degrade DOM also in anoxic aquatic environments, and we focus here on inland waters as a particular case study. A suite of biogeochemical DOM functions that have received comparatively little attention may only be expressed in anoxic conditions and may result in enhanced biogeochemical roles of these deoxygenated habitats on a network scale.},

abstract = {Subtropical reservoirs are an important source of atmospheric methane (CH4). This study investigated the spatiotemporal variability of bubble and diffusive CH4 emissions from a subtropical reservoir, including its upstream and downstream rivers, in eastern China. There was no obvious seasonal variation in CH4 emissions from the main reservoir, which increased slightly from the first half year to the next half year. In the upstream river, CH4 emissions were low from February to June and fluctuated widely from July to January due to bubble activity. In the downstream river, CH4 emissions were lowest in February, which was possibly influenced by the low streamflow rate from the reservoir (275 m3 s−1) and a short period of mixing. There was spatial variability in CH4 emissions, where fluxes were highest from the upstream river (3.65 ± 3.24 mg CH4 m−2 h−1) and lowest from the main reservoir (0.082 ± 0.061 mg CH4 m−2 h−1), and emissions from the downstream river were 0.49 ± 0.20 mg CH4 m−2 h−1. Inflow rivers are hot spots in bubble CH4 emissions that should be examined using field-sampling strategies. This study will improve the accuracy of current and future estimations of CH4 emissions from hydroelectric systems and will help guide mitigation strategies for greenhouse gas emissions.},

abstract = {The variability in coefficients of absorption for phytoplankton was assessed for an area off the Southwest coast of Portugal. This area included three sites at 2, 10 and 18 km perpendicular to the coast, sampled at surface, mid-Secchi and Secchi depths at each site. Phytoplankton absorption coefficients were transformed into specific coefficients (an ph(l)) by normalizing them with respect to chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The influence on the variability of the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton was assessed for physico- chemical and biological parameters such as nutrients or Chla levels, as well as size structure and abundance of the phytoplankton community. The results showed that the phytoplankton absorption coefficients decreased from inshore to offshore, but were relatively constant within the water column, revealing a well-mixed column. The an ph(l) varied inversely with Chla content, with minima in Autumn and Spring, matching phytoplankton blooms. The effects of the size structure of the community and pigment composition on the variability of phytoplankton absorption coefficient were studied and results showed that size structure had a greater influence on the variability of the phytoplankton absorption, although the pigment contribution was also important},

abstract = {Lakes are major sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere that contribute significantly to the global budget. Recent studies have shown that diffusive fluxes, ebullition and surface water CH4 concentrations can differ significantly within lakes—spatially and temporally. CH4 fluxes may be affected at longer scales in response to seasons, temperature, lake mixing events, short term weather events like pressure variations, shifting winds and diel cycles. Frequent measurements of fluxes in the same system and integrated assessments of the impacts of the spatio-temporal variability are rare. Thereby, large scale assessments frequently lack information on this variability which can potentially lead to biased estimates. In this study, we analysed the variability of CH4 fluxes and surface water CH4 concentrations across open water areas of lakes in a small catchment in southwest Sweden over two annual cycles. Significant patterns in CH4 concentrations, diffusive fluxes, ebullition and total fluxes were observed in space (between and within lakes) and in time (over diel cycles to years). Differences observed among the lakes can be associated with lake characteristics. The spatial variability within lakes was linked to depth or distance to stream inlets. Temporal variability was observed at diel to seasonal scales and was influenced by weather events. The fluxes increased exponentially with temperature in all three lakes, with stronger temperature dependence with decreasing depth. By comparing subsets of our data with estimates using all data we show that considering the spatio-temporal variability in CH4 fluxes is critical when making whole lake or annual budgets.},

abstract = {We estimated carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions by diffusion, ebullition, and degassing in turbines from a semi-arid hydropower reservoir in northeastern Brazil. Sampling sites were allocated within the littoral and deeper waters of one embayment, the main-stream, and at turbines. Annual carbon emissions were estimated at 2.3 × 105 ± 7.45 × 104 t C year−1, or in CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq) at 1.33 × 106 ± 4.5 × 105 t CO2-eq year−1. Diffusion across the water surface was the main pathway accounting for 96{\%} of total carbon emissions. Ebullition was limited to littoral areas. A slight accumulation of CO2, but not of CH4, in bottom waters close to the turbines inlet led to degassing emissions about 8 × 103 t C year−1. Emissions in littoral areas were higher than in main-stream and contribute to 40{\%} of the total carbon. Carbon (C) emissions per electricity generated, at 60{\%} of installed capacity, is 0.05 t C-CO2-eq MWh−1. The ratio increases to 0.09 t C-CO2 MWh−1, equating 80{\%} of the emissions from natural gas and 40{\%} of diesel or coal power plants. Retention time and benthic metabolism were identified as main drivers for carbon emissions in littoral areas, while water column mixing and rapid water flow are important factors preventing CH4 accumulation and loss by degassing. Our results indicate that Itaparica Reservoir, located in the semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil, acts as a source of GHGs. Management measurements are needed to prevent emissions to raise in the future.},

abstract = {Human population growth has increased the demand for water and clean energy, leading to the massive construction of reservoirs. Reservoirs can emit greenhouse gases (GHG) affecting the atmospheric radiative budget. The radiative forcing due to CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions and the relative contribution of each GHG in terms of CO2 equivalents to the total forcing is practically unknown. We determined simultaneously the CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes in reservoirs from diverse watersheds and under variable human pressure to cover the vast idiosyncrasy of temperate Mediterranean reservoirs. We obtained that GHG fluxes ranged more than three orders of magnitude. The reservoirs were sources of CO2 and N2O when the watershed lithology was mostly calcareous, and the crops and the urban areas dominated the landscape. By contrast, reservoirs were sinks of CO2 and N2O when the watershed lithology was predominantly siliceous, and the landscape had more than 40{\%} of forestal coverage. All reservoirs were sources of CH4, and emissions were determined mostly by reservoir mean depth and water temperature. The radiative forcing was substantially higher during the stratification than during the mixing. During the stratification the radiative forcings ranged from 125 mg CO2 equivalents m-2 d-1 to 31 884 mg CO2 equivalents m-2 d-1 and were dominated by the CH4 emissions; whereas during the mixing the radiative forcings ranged from 29 mg CO2 equivalents m-2 d-1 to 722 mg CO2 equivalents m-2 d-1 and were dominated by CO2 emissions. The N2O contribution to the radiative forcing was minor except in one reservoir with a landscape dominated by crops and urban areas. Future construction of reservoirs should consider that siliceous bedrocks, forestal landscapes, and deep canyons could minimize their radiative forcings.},

abstract = {In thermally stratified lakes, nutrient-enriched hypolimnion and a nutrient-depleted epilimnion is a common feature. Vertical mixing between these layers affects geochemical and biological processes. We used chloride ion as an inert tracer to model the main factors controlling the chemical stratification and to identify lake-wide mixing processes. The stratified lake is treated as two completely mixed reservoirs separated by the thermocline. Based on the long-term records of temperature, hydrochemical, and hydrological data from Lake Kinneret (Israel) and Lake Biwa (Japan), monthly hypolimnetic and epilimnetic chloride concentrations were predicted and tested against measured chloride concentration profiles. Water-volume exchange between the layers during the thermocline deepening was calculated using mass balance. We found that changes in the epilimnetic and hypolimnetic inventories of an inert tracer (chloride) correspond quantitatively to the calculated water mass exchange, and as such, reflect mixing. Our inert-tracer-approach provides a basis for an operational means of quantifying the vertical mixing process in thermally stratified lakes independently from the heat budget.},

abstract = {Lakes are a natural source of methane to the atmosphere and contribute significantly to total emissions compared to the oceans. Controls on methane emissions from lake surfaces, particularly biotic processes within anoxic hypolimnia, are only partially understood. Here we investigated biological methane oxidation in the water column of the seasonally stratified Lake Rotsee. A zone of methane oxidation extending from the oxic/anoxic interface into anoxic waters was identified by chemical profiling of oxygen, methane and $\delta$13C of methane. Incubation experiments with 13C-methane yielded highest oxidation rates within the oxycline, and comparable rates were measured in anoxic waters. Despite predominantly anoxic conditions within the zone of methane oxidation, known groups of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea were conspicuously absent. Instead, aerobic gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs were identified as the active methane oxidizers. In addition, continuous oxidation and maximum rates always occurred under light conditions. These findings, along with the detection of chlorophyll a, suggest that aerobic methane oxidation is tightly coupled to light-dependent photosynthetic oxygen production both at the oxycline and in the anoxic bottom layer. It is likely that this interaction between oxygenic phototrophs and aerobic methanotrophs represents a widespread mechanism by which methane is oxidized in lake water, thus diminishing its release into the atmosphere.},

Whereas communities in unmodified conditions were structured deterministically with significant species segregation, catchment-scale conversion to agriculture and sediment deposition at the patch- or micro-habitat scale apparently randomized species co-occurrences. This shift from non-random to random was mostly independent of species richness, abundance and spatial scale. Data on community-wide life-history traits (body size, dispersal ability and predatory habits) and beta-diversity indicated that anthropogenic modification disrupted community assembly by affecting biotic interactions and, to a lesser extent, altering habitat heterogeneity. These data illustrate that the balance between predictable and stochastic patterns in communities can reflect anthropogenic modifications that not only transcend scales but also change the relative forces that determine species coexistence. Research into the effects of habitat modification as a key to understanding global change should extend beyond species richness and composition to include species co-occurrence, species interactions and any functional consequences. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Diurnal cycles of sulfate reduction were examined in a well-developed cyanobacterial mat which grew in an outdoor experimental hypersaline pond system at a constant salinity of 75 ± 5{\%} for 3 years. Vertical profiles of sulfate reduction were determined for the upper 12 mm of the microbial mat. Sulfate reduction activities were compared with diurnal variations of oxygen and sulfide concentrations measured by microelectrodes. Significant activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria was detected under aerobic conditions during the daytime, with maximal activity at 2 p.m. When comparing sulfate reduction activities in sediment cores taken at 6 a.m. and 12 a.m. and incubated at a constant temperature in the light and in the dark, a distinct stimulation of the activity in the vertical profile of sulfate reduction by light was evident. It is therefore concluded that the maximal in situ activities, measured at 2 p.m. in the chemocline of the cyanobacterial mat, cannot be attributed to diurnal changes of temperature alone. The response of sulfate- reducing bacteria to the addition of specific carbon sources was significantly different in the cyanobacterial layer, the anoxygenic phototrophic bacterial layer, and the permanently reduced layer of the microbial mat. Sulfate reduction in the mat layer exposed to high oxygen concentrations as a result of cyanobacterial oxygenic photosynthesis was enhanced only by glycolate; in the microzone where the chemocline is found during the daytime, ethanol was the only carbon source to enhance sulfate reduction, while both ethanol and lactate enhanced this activity in the permanently reduced zone.},

abstract = {Due to climate change, many lakes in Europe will be subject to higher variability of hydrological characteristics in their littoral zones. These different hydrological regimes might affect the use of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon sources. We used sandy sediment microcosms to examine the effects of different hydrological regimes (wet, desiccating, and wet-desiccation cycles) on carbon turnover. 13C-labelled particulate organic carbon was used to trace and estimate carbon uptake into bacterial biomass (via phospholipid fatty acids) and respiration. Microbial community changes were monitored by combining DNA- and RNA-based real-time PCR quantification and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of 16S rRNA. The shifting hydrological regimes in the sediment primarily caused two linked microbial effects: changes in the use of available organic carbon and community composition changes. Drying sediments yielded the highest CO2 emission rates, whereas hydrological shifts increased the uptake of allochthonous organic carbon for respiration. T-RFLP patterns demonstrated that only the most extreme hydrological changes induced a significant shift in the active and total bacterial communities. As current scenarios of climate change predict an increase of drought events, frequent variations of the hydrological regimes of many lake littoral zones in central Europe are anticipated. Based on the results of our study, this phenomenon may increase the intensity and amplitude in rates of allochthonous organic carbon uptake and CO2 emissions.},

As ecology becomes a more data-rich scientific discipline, the next generation of ecologists needs to develop the quantitative literacy required to effectively analyze, visualize, and interpret large datasets. We developed and assessed three modules to teach undergraduate freshwater ecology students both scientific concepts and quantitative skills needed to work with large datasets. These modules covered key ecological topics of phenology, physical mixing, and the balance between primary production and respiration, using lakes as model systems with high-frequency or long-term data. Our assessment demonstrated that participating in these modules significantly increased student comfort using spreadsheet software and their self-reported competence in performing a variety of quantitative tasks. Interestingly, students with the lowest pre-module comfort and skills achieved the biggest gains. Furthermore, students reported that participating in the modules helped them better understand the concepts presented and that they appreciated practicing quantitative skills. Our approach demonstrates that working with large datasets in ecology classrooms helps undergraduate students develop the skills and knowledge needed to help solve complex ecological problems and be more prepared for a data-intensive future.},

abstract = {Lakes and reservoirs typically emit CO 2 to the atmosphere as a result of respiration in excess of primary production. For reservoirs, this respiration is often assumed to be primarily of benthic origin, associated with drowned vegetation and soils. This study took measurements from a young hydroelectric reservoir (Eastmain-1) in boreal Canada and nearby natural lakes to compare the rates of water column respiration and hypolimnetic CO 2 accumulation during a stratified period. Reservoir water column respiration rates were significantly higher than those in natural lakes, with surface means of 61.4 ± 4.6 mg C m -3 d -1 in Eastmain-1 and 40.2 ± 3 mg C m -3 d -1 in lakes and profundal means of 58.1 ± 11 mg C m -3 d -1 in Eastmain-1 and 17.6 ± 7.5 mg C m -3 d -1 in lakes. Reservoir hypolimnetic CO 2 accumulation rates were also higher than those in natural lakes, with means of 78.8 ± 16 mg C m -3 d -1 in Eastmain-1 and 19.8 ± 2.7 mg C m -3 d -1 in lakes. Our findings further indicate that the relative contribution of benthic respiration (estimated as the difference between hypolimnetic CO 2 accumulation and water column respiration) toward total net CO 2 production during stratified periods was similar in both aquatic systems (23{\%} in lakes, 27{\%} in Eastmain-1). By identifying the major role of the water column in the reservoir's CO 2 production, this study calls for a significant paradigm shift away from the common assumption that reservoir CO 2 emissions are predominantly the result of decaying vegetation in the benthic environment.

abstract = {Surface water-methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations were measured and diffusive fluxes were estimated in three subtropical freshwater reservoirs (Little Nerang Dam (LND), Lake Wivenhoe (LW) and Lake Baroon (LB)) in southeast Queensland, Australia, during four seasons in 2011-2012. All reservoirs were strong sources of CH4 in all seasons. Surface water CH4 varied between 1350 and 524 000{\%} saturation, and was overall highest in spring and summer, and lowest in winter, however, with no clear patterns common to all reservoirs. In contrast, all reservoirs switched from weak N2O sinks in spring to strong N2O sources for the rest of the year. N2O saturation in all reservoirs varied between 70 and 1230{\%}. There were significant differences for CH4 concentrations and fluxes between the reservoirs. Within each reservoir, there was strong spatial CH4 variability but minimal N2O saturation variability. CH4 saturation was higher in inflow zones than in the main body. Area-weighted average fluxes were estimated using six water-air gas transfer velocity estimation models and resulted in fluxes in the range 4.8-20.5, 2.3-5.4, and 2.3-7.5 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, while N2O was 0.07-0.41, 0.09-0.22, and 0.03-0.09 mg N2O m-2 d-1 for LND, LW, and LB, respectively. Total emissions, in carbon dioxide equivalents, from all measurement campaigns were CH4 dominated (67-86{\%}). The measured degree of CH4 saturation and fluxes are among the highest reported thus far indicating that subtropical freshwater reservoirs could be significant aquatic greenhouse gas sources. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the interplay between biogeochemical processes and the physical forcing driving the water-air gaseous emissions. The high variability coupled with the lack of consensus among estimation models calls for concerted efforts to address uncertainty of measurements for reliable emissions accounting.},

Fluxes were obtained with a floating chamber connected to an automated NDIR or a FTIR instrument.

Our results showed a strong similarity between lakes, rivers, and old reservoirs across a 5000 km transect from the west coast to the east cost of Canada. These values are comparable to those observed in Finland or in the sub-tropical semi-arid western USA. Although several limnological parameters can influence these fluxes, none showed a statistical relationship. However, levels of CO2 or CH4 fluxes are influenced by pH, wind speed, depth at sampling stations and latitude.},

abstract = {In South African estuaries, there is no knowledge on the resilience and variability in phytoplankton communities under conditions of hypersalinity, extended droughts and reverse salinity gradients. Phytoplankton composition, abundance and biomass vary with changes in environmental variables and taxa richness declines specifically under hypersaline conditions. This research thus investigated the phytoplankton community composition, its resilience and variability under highly variable and extreme environmental conditions in an estuarine lake system (Lake St. Lucia, South Africa) over one year. The lake system was characterised by a reverse salinity gradient with hypersalinity furthest from the estuarine inlet during the study period. During this study, 78 taxa were recorded: 56 diatoms, eight green algae, one cryptophyte, seven cyanobacteria and six dinoflagellates. Taxon variability and resilience depended on their ability to tolerate high salinities. Consequently, the phytoplankton communities as well as total abundance and biomass differed along the salinity gradient and over time with salinity as the main determinant. Cyanobacteria were dominant in hypersaline conditions, dinoflagellates in marine-brackish salinities, green algae and cryptophytes in lower salinities (brackish) and diatoms were abundant in marine-brackish salinities but survived in hypersaline conditions. Total abundance and biomass ranged from 3.66??10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to 1.11??10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}9{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Cells/L and 1.21??10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}6{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to 1.46??10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}10{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}pgC/L respectively, with the highest values observed under hypersaline conditions. Therefore, even under highly variable, extreme environmental conditions and hypersalinity the phytoplankton community as a whole was resilient enough to maintain a relatively high biomass throughout the study period. The resilience of few dominant taxa, such as Cyanothece, Spirulina, Protoperidinium and Nitzschia and the dominance of other common genera such as Chlamydomonas, Chroomonas, Navicula, Gyrosigma, Oxyrrhis, and Prorocentrum, provided the carbon at the base of the food web in the system and showed that even during the extended period of drought, a foundation for productivity can be provided for once conditions improve.},

abstract = {1.We analysed 41 years of data (1968-2008) from Blelham Tarn, U.K., to determine the consequences of eutrophication and climate warming on hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO). 2.The establishment of thermal stratification was strongly related to the onset of DO depletion in the lower hypolimnion. As a result of a progressively earlier onset of stratification and later overturn, the duration of stratification increased by 38±8days over the 41years. 3.The observed rate of volumetric hypolimnetic oxygen depletion (VHOD obs) ranged from 0.131 to 0.252gO 2m -3 per day and decreased significantly over the study period, despite the increase in the mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in the growing season. The vertical transport of DO represented from 0 to 30{\%} of VHOD obs, while adjustments for interannual differences in hypolimnetic temperature were less important, ranging from -11 to 9{\%} of VHOD obs. 4.The mean wind speed during May made the strongest significant contribution to the variation in VHOD obs. VHOD obs adjusted for the vertical transport of DO and hypolimnetic temperature differences, VHOD adj, was significantly related to the upper mixed layer Chl a concentration during spring. 5.Hypolimnetic anoxia (HA) ranged from 27 to 168days per year and increased significantly over time, which undoubtedly had negative ecological consequences for the lake. 6.In similar small temperate lakes, the negative effects of eutrophication on hypolimnetic DO are likely to be exacerbated by changes in lake thermal structure brought about by a warming climate, which may undermine management efforts to alleviate the effects of anthropogenic eutrophication. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The average CH 4 flux was much less than that reported from reservoirs in tropic and temperate regions. The photosynthesis of phytoplankton dominated the diel gas fluxes during alga bloom in spring and summer. The maximum monthly flux occurred in June 2010 and corresponded to the lowest water level. Water temperature, sediment temperature, and TOC did not have significant correlation with the monthly CH 4 fluxes. Continuously decreasing hydrostatic pressure and the low water level resulted in more CH 4 emission at the sediment-water during the discharging period, and thus increases the CH 4 effluxes because the diffusion time through a thin water column is shorter and less CH 4 may be oxidized compared with that in a long water column.},

abstract = {Biomass size spectra were calculated from comprehensive microscopic assessment of plankton organisms in large, deep Lake Constance (Bodcnsec). They revealed an approximately constant size distribution of biomass from bacteria (10 I4 g C cell-‘) to crustaceans ( 1O-4 g C ind.-‘), resembling distributions found in open marine systems (seasonal average). Size ranges without detectable biomass as reported from other lakes did not exist. External perturbations, and size and depth of the pelagic zone, but not the type of habitat (marine vs. limnetic) were suggested as crucial factors influencing the shape of the biomass size distribution. The fit of the normalized biomass size spectrum to a straight line with a slope of - 1 .OO was very close (rZ = 0.98), indicating a decrease of abundance per size class N proportional to the increase of body weight w (N cc w-l). Seasonal variation of biomass per size class was strongly related to body weight. It was largest for organisms with generation times of about 1 yr. Slopes of normalized biomass size spectra were steep in early spring (- 1.16) indicating a dominance of small organisms and a low transfer cfficicncy to larger organisms. From spring to early summer, the size distribution of organisms shifted toward larger organisms (slope up to -0.94). The seasonal changes of the size spectra support the idea that, due to differences in the intrinsic reaction times of differently sized organisms, varying environmental conditions produce less regularly shaped actual size spectra, if not averaged over a period longer than the external fluctuations.},

abstract = {The effects of body mass and temperature on metabolic rate (MR) are among the most widely examined physiological relationships. Recently, these relationships have been incorporated into themetabolic theory of ecology (MTE) that links the ecology of populations, communities and ecosystems to the MR of indi- vidual organisms. The fundamental equation of MTE derives the relation between mass and MR using first principles and predicts the temperature dependence of MR based on biochemical kinetics. It is a deliberately simple, zeroth-order approximation that represents a baseline against which variation in real biological systems can be examined. In the present study, we evaluate the fundamental equation of MTE against other more parameter-rich models for MR using an information-theoretic approach to penalize the inclusion of additional parameters. Using a comparative database of MR measurements for 1359 species, from 11 groups ranging from prokaryotes to mammals, and spanning 16 orders of mag- nitude in mass and a 598C range in body temperature, we show that differences between taxa in the mass and temperature dependence of MR are sufficiently large as to be retained in the best model for MR despite the requirement for estimation of 22 more parameters than the fundamental equation of MTE.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of extensive nutrient data sets from two river-dominated coastal ecosystems, the northern Adriatic Sea and the northern Gulf of Mexico, demonstrating significant changes in surface nutrient ratios over a period of 30 years. The silicon:nitrogen ratios have decreased, indicating increased potential for silicon limitation. The nitrogen:phosphorus and the silicon:phosphorus ratios have also changed substantially, and the coastal nutrient structures have become more balanced and potentially less limiting for phytoplankton growth. It is likely that net phytoplankton productivity increased under these conditions and was accompanied by increasing bottom water hypoxia and major changes in community species composition. These findings support the hypothesis that increasing coastal eutrophication to date may be associated with stoichiometric nutrient balance, due to increasing potential for silicon limitation and decreasing potential for nitrogen and phosphorus limitation. On a worldwide basis, coastal ecosystems adjacent to rivers influenced by anthropogenic nutrient loads may experience similar alterations.},

abstract = {The Alboran Sea (southwestern Mediterranean) exhibits strong horizontal and vertical gradients associated with macroscale and mesoscale physical structures due to the input of surface Atlantic waters into the Mediterranean basin. During the summer of 1992, two anticyclonic and two cyclonic areas were found with fluorescence maxima (DFM) below the seasonal thermocline (ST). Although the depth of the ST is fairly constant, the position and intensity of the DFM is more variable, with a tendency to deepening and smoothing in the anticyclonic gyres. The position of the Atlantic–Mediterranean interface (AMI) can be used as a tracer for cyclonic or anticyclonic dynamics and their potential biological effects. A shallow AMI indicates divergence or upwelling dynamics and coincides with the highest fluorescence intensity, chlorophyll concentration and phytoplankton biovolume in the DFM. Under the conditions typical of the two anticyclonic gyres, the contrary is found. The size structure of phytoplankton shows significant differences between cyclonic and anticyclonic structures. Log-transformed size-abundance spectra can be adequately described by linear models with slopes of −0.78 for cyclonic and −0.93 for anticyclonic structures. The integration of size-abundance spectra indicates that picoplankton biovolume in the DFM is independent of the type of circulation or dynamics, whereas nanoplankton and, particularly, microplankton increase their absolute and relative presence in the DFM under cyclonic or upwelling dynamics.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton communities in lakes and reservoirs are seldom homogeneously distributed but usually aggregate in patches and gradients. In this study we have combined the use of in vivo spectrofluorometry and acoustic Doppler current profiling to investigate the effect of water movements on the spatial distribution of cyanobacteria and diatoms in a thermally stratified reservoir in SW Spain. The distinctive canyon-shaped morphometry of the reservoir (El Gergal) favoured the development of a "conveyor belt" pattern of circulation aligned with the long axis of the reservoir. Under non-regulated conditions, the spatial distribution of phytoplankton was almost entirely dependent on the interactions between advective transport and the buoyancy properties of the different functional groups of phytoplankton. The positively-buoyant cyanobacteria accumulated near the surface and were then transported downwind by the surface drift currents. In contrast, the negatively-buoyant diatoms sank in the water column and were transported upwind by the sub-surface return currents. When deep water was abstracted from the reservoir, these distribution patterns were modified. The results are discussed in relation to the problem of acquiring representative water samples from the reservoir and the application of a simple empirical model to optimize the location of the station used for routine cyanobacteria sampling on the reservoir.},

abstract = {Waterbird aggregations and droughts affect nutrient and microbial dynamics in wetlands. We analysed the effects of high densities of flamingos on nutrients and microbial dynamics in a saline lake during a wet and a dry hydrological year, and explored the effects of guano on prokaryotic growth. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, total phosphorus and total nitrogen in the surface waters were 2–3 fold higher during the drought and were correlated with salinity. Flamingos stimulated prokaryotic heterotrophic production and triggered cascading effects on prokaryotic abundance, viruses and dissolved nitrogen. This stimulus of heterotrophic prokaryotes was associated with soluble phosphorus inputs from guano, and also from sediments. In the experiments, the specific growth rate and the carrying capacity were almost twice as high after guano addition than in the control treatments, and were coupled with soluble phosphorus assimilation. Flamingo guano was also rich in nitrogen. Dissolved N in lake water lagged behind the abundance of flamingos, but the causes of this lag are unclear. This study demonstrates that intense droughts could lead to increases in total nutrients in wetlands; however, microbial activity is likely constrained by the availability of soluble phosphorus, which appears to be more dependent on the abundance of waterbirds.},

abstract = {1. Wind is considered the dominant factor controlling phytoplankton distribution in lentic environments. In canyon-shaped reservoirs, wind tends to blow along the main axis generating internal seiches and advective water movements that jointly with biological features of algae can produce a heterogeneous phytoplankton distribution. Turbulence generated by wind stress and convection will also affect the vertical distribution of algae, depending on their sinking properties. 2. We investigated the vertical and horizontal distribution of phytoplankton during the stratification period in Sau Reservoir (NE Spain). Sites along the main reservoir axis were sampled every 4 h for 3 days, and profiles of chlorophyll-a and temperature were made using a fluorescent FluoroProbe, which can discriminate among the main algal groups. Convective and wind shear velocity scales, and energy dissipation were calculated from meteorological data, and simulation experiments were performed to describe non-measured processes, like vertical advection and sinking velocity of phytoplankton. 3. Wind direction changed from day to night, producing a diel thermocline oscillation and an internal seiche. Energy dissipation was moderate during the night, and mainly attributed to convective cooling. During the day the energy dissipation was entirely attributed to wind shear, but values indicated low turbulence intensity. 4. The epilimnetic algal community was mainly composed of diatoms and chlorophytes. Chlorophytes showed a homogeneous distribution on the horizontal and vertical planes. Diatom horizontal pattern was also homogeneous, because the horizontal advective velocities generated by wind forcing were not high enough to develop phytoplankton gradients along the reservoir. 5. Diatom vertical distribution was heterogeneous in space and time. Different processes dominated in different regions of the reservoir, due to the interaction between seiching and the daily cycle of convective-mediated turbulence. As the meteorological forcing followed a clear daily pattern, we found very different diatom sedimentation dynamics between day and night. Remarkably, these dynamics were asynchronous in the extremes of the seiche, implying that under the same meteorological forcing a diatom population can show contrasting sedimentation dynamics at small spatial scales (approximately 10(3) m). This finding should be taken into account when interpreting paleolimnological records from different locations in a lake. 6. Vertical distribution of non-motile algae is a complex process including turbulence, vertical and horizontal advection, variations in the depth of the mixing layer and the intrinsic sinking properties of the organisms. Thus, simplistic interpretations considering only one of these factors should be regarded with caution. The results of this work also suggest that diatoms can persist in stratified water because of a synergistic effect between seiching and convective turbulence.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton need multiple resources to grow and reproduce (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron), but the receptors through which they acquire resources are, in many cases, the same channels through which viruses attack. Therefore, phytoplankton can face a bottom-up vs. top-down tradeoff in receptor allocation: Optimize resource uptake or minimize virus attack? We investigate this top-down vs. bottom-up tradeoff using an evolutionary ecology model of multiple essential resources, specialist viruses that attack through the resource receptors, and a phytoplankton population that can evolve to alter the fraction of receptors used for each resource/virus type. Without viruses present the singular continuously stable strategy is to allocate receptors such that resources are co-limiting, which also minimizes the equilibrium concentrations of both resources. Only one virus type can be present at equilibrium (because phytoplankton, in this model, are a single resource for viruses), and when a virus type is present, it controls the equilibrium phytoplankton population size. Despite this top-down control on equilibrium densities, bottom-up control determines the evolutionary outcome. Regardless of which virus type is present, the allocation strategy that yields co-limitation between the two resources is continuously stable. This is true even when the virus type attacking through the limiting resource channel is present, even though selection for co-limitation in this case decreases the equilibrium phytoplankton population and does not decrease the equilibrium concentration of the limiting resource. Therefore, although moving toward co-limitation and decreasing the equilibrium concentration of the limiting resource often co-occur in models, it is co-limitation, and not necessarily the lowest equilibrium concentration of the limiting resource, that is the result of selection. This result adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that co-limitation at equilibrium is a winning strategy. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Whole-lake carbon (C) mass-balance budgets were constructed for a chain of six hard-water lakes to quantify the relative importance of organic carbon (OC) and inorganic carbon (IC) exchanges between atmosphere, water column, sediments, and rivers. Mean summer C fluxes were calculated for each lake during the ice-free periods (May to September) of 1995-2007 by measuring deposition of IC and OC in lake sediments, export of C to outflow rivers, lotic C influxes, and atmospheric exchange of CO2. Unlike soft-water lakes, IC in rivers accounted for 68.2-85.6{\%} of total C (TC) influx to these hard-water lakes, CO2 efflux accounted for 0-44.5{\%} of total C export (median 2.8{\%}), and sedimentation buried similar amounts of OC and IC. Deposition of C in sediments accounted for 1.8-61.7{\%} of total export and was correlated to water residence time, while C efflux through rivers accounted for 32.6-98.2{\%} of total export, mainly as IC (69.6-85.1{\%} of TC). Unexpectedly, estimates of net ecosystem production based on OC mass balances suggested that all lakes were autotrophic (production {\textgreater} respiration) during summer, despite elevated dissolved organic carbon content (5.6-16.1 mg C L-1), pCO2 values, and net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from three lakes. We conclude that C fluxes within and among these hard-water lakes are regulated by hydrologic inputs of dissolved IC rather than by lake metabolism, IC and OC pathways are only loosely coupled, and future climate variability will alter C fluxes in similar lakes mainly through regulation of mass transfer from land. {\textcopyright} 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

Apart from traditional microbiological methods based on cultivation and on measuring the process rates with radioactive labels, in situ fluorescent hybridization (FISH) was used, which enables identification and quantification without cultivating organisms. The peak rate of sulfate reduction, 0.486 $\mu$g S l-1 day-1, was found in the chemocline at 33 m. The peak SRB number of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml, as determined by the most probable number method on selective media, was found at the same depth. The phylogenetic affiliation of the SRB, as determined by FISH, revealed the predominance of the Desulfovibrio spp., Desulfobulbus spp., and Desulfoarculus spp./Desulfomonile spp. groups. The numbers of spore-forming Desulfotomaculum spp. increased with depth. The low measured rates of sulfate reduction accompanied by high SRB numbers and the predominance of the groups capable of reducing a wide range of substrates permit us to assume utilization of electron acceptors other than sulfate as the main activity of the SRB in the water column. {\textcopyright} Pleiades Publishing, Inc., 2006.},

abstract = {The metabolic rate of organisms may be viewed as a basic property from which other vital rates and many ecological patterns emerge and that follows a universal allometric mass scaling law, or it may be considered a property of the organism that emerges as a result of the adaptation to the environment, with consequently fewer universal mass scaling properties. Here, we examine the mass scaling of respiration and maximum feeding (clearance and ingestion rates) and growth rates of heterotrophic pelagic organisms over an ∼10(15) range in body mass. We show that clearance and respiration rates have life-form-dependent allometries that have similar scaling but different intercepts, such that the mass-specific rates converge on a rather narrow size-independent range. In contrast, ingestion and growth rates follow a near-universal taxa-independent ∼3/4 mass scaling power law. We argue that the declining mass-specific clearance rates with size within taxa is related to the inherent decrease in feeding efficiency of any particular feeding mode. The transitions between feeding mode and simultaneous transitions in clearance and respiration rates may then represent adaptations to the food environment and be the result of the optimization of trade-offs that allow sufficient feeding and growth rates to balance mortality.},

abstract = {In this paper we compared two different approaches to estimate plankton energy consumption: (i) combination of the observed biomass-size spectrum and empirical allometric relationships between respiration and body size, and (ii) the experimental measurement of ETS (electronic transfer system) activity. The first approach was carried out through both discrete and continuous models. Results indicated a good agreement between predicted and observed metabolism in both a freshwater and an oceanic plankton assemblage from bacteria to zooplankton. The discrete integration of the spectrum accounts better for changing systems than continuous integration, which is more appropriate for theoretical approaches to studying the metabolism of the community. The combination of biomass spectrum slopes and allometric exponents was critical in metabolism sensitivity to size structure: flatter biomass slopes (as found in microbial assemblages) allow for greater variations in this size range to the total metabolism contribution of the planktonic community. For future studies, the fast progression in technical discrimination and measurement of particles makes this approach a promising tool for the analysis of energy in planktonic ecosystems.},

abstract = {The biomass and size structure of phytoplankton were compared in the temporarily open/closed Mdloti and Mhlanga estuaries, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Samples and measurements were taken between March 2002 and March 2003, to assess the effects of differing mouth breaching regimes, freshwater inflow and nutrient loading on the dynamics of phytoplankton. The Mdloti Estuary exhibits a larger catchment area (≈500 km2), substantial upstream impoundment (Hazelmere Dam) and little discharge of treated sewage waters in its upper reaches (8 Ml d-1). Conversely, the Mhlanga Estuary has a smaller catchment area (≈100 km2), no upstream dams and a large inflow of treated sewage waters (20 Ml d-1), resulting in a capping flow of 0.23 m3 s-1. DIN and DIP concentrations were usually well above the accepted threshold levels (2 $\mu$M for DIN and 0.5 $\mu$M for DIP) for nutrient-limited primary production and were also much higher in the Mhlanga than in the Mdloti. This led to episodes of eutrophication, with high levels of mean chl-a occurring in the Mhlanga Estuary in particular. In both estuaries, highest chl-a concentrations occurred during the closed phase, while the lowest occurred during the open phase. Phytoplankton biomass ranged from 0.869 to 111 mg chl-a m-3 in the Mdloti, and from 0.732 to 303 mg chl-a m-3 in the Mhlanga. The maximum value of 303 mg m -3 of chl-a, recorded at the Mhlanga in October 2002, is the highest chl-a concentration ever recorded in any South African estuary. In both estuaries, phytoplankton biomass was dominated by the nanophytoplankton fraction (2-20 $\mu$m) during the entire study period. This accounted for an average of 80.6{\%} and 79.6{\%} of the total phytoplankton biomass in the Mdloti and the Mhlanga, respectively. This was followed by the picophytoplankton ({\textless}2 $\mu$m), with 12.9{\%} at the Mdloti and 11.9{\%} at the Mhlanga and the microphytoplankton ({\textgreater}20 $\mu$m) with 6.53{\%} at the Mdloti and 8.65{\%} at the Mhlanga. Due to the large volumes of treated sewage released into the two estuaries, particularly the Mhlanga, they breached more frequently than they would have under natural circumstances. Thus, despite their high nutrient concentrations, eutrophic waters within the estuaries exhibited a short residence time, thereby restricting the time available for phytoplankton to take up enough nutrients to form more regular and intense blooms. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Changes in catchment land-use and sedimentation have large ecological effects on rivers, but there is limited transferable understanding of the consequences for river conservation. In the Usk river system (Wales, UK), we assessed whether catchment-scale change in land-use and patch-scale sedimentation (i) affected organisms with specific life-history traits and (ii) resulted in nested assemblages with species-poor sites occupied mostly by sub-sets of organisms from richer sites.Reaches in catchments converted to agriculture had nested species assemblages characterised by greater representation of organisms with small body size, shorter life cycle and effective dispersal capacity. In contrast, richer sites in semi-natural catchments supported taxa with longer life cycles. Patch-scale sedimentation was also accompanied by nested patterns in which depauperate patches supported taxa mostly with shorter life cycles, small size and detrital feeding habits. Sediment-free patches were richer and characterised by larger taxa, poor dispersers and predators. Trait diversity was reduced by habitat modification at both scales.We conclude that habitat modification in this river catchment has led to the systematic drop-out at two different scales of specific groups of organisms with particular trait character. Large-scale agricultural intensification appears to have removed larger, longer-lived invertebrates that probably require stable conditions, and we advocate further studies to appraise whether such organisms are at risk more globally from land-use conversion. This river case study is one of the first to combine nestedness analysis with biological trait assessment and it might help in developing transferable methods to predict the conservation impacts of land-use change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This study explores the dynamic changes in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) with depth, and the temporal variations of CO2 net atmospheric flux (NAF) in a stratified reservoir. A total of 16 field campaigns were conducted from the summer stratification to fall turnover period in 2017. A random forest (RF) model was developed to estimate the pCO2 using concurrently measured water quality variables. The results showed that the vertical distribution of pCO2 and associated temporal variations of the NAF are closely related to the stratification strength of the reservoir. The reservoir surface pCO2 was supersaturated (1542 µatm) in summer (July 11), but this decreased to undersaturation as algae grew. Meanwhile, dissolved CO2 continuously accumulated below the reservoir mixed-layer due to the thermal stratification barrier and organic-rich floodwater intrusion. Vertical mixing began instantly as the stratification strength began to weaken in mid-October, and the surface pCO2 increased sharply up to 1934 µatm. Consequently, the NAF drastically increased to 3235 mg−CO2 m−2{\textperiodcentered}day−1, which implies that the NAF changes seasonally and large CO2 pulsing occurs during the turnover events. The results provide valuable information about pCO2 variability and physical mixing processes, as well as carbon budget estimation in stratified reservoirs, and offer an improved understanding of these phenomena.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Freshwater reservoirs are important sites of organic carbon (OC) burial, but the extent to which reservoir OC burial is a new anthropogenic carbon sink is currently unclear. While burial of aquatic OC (by, e.g., phytoplankton) in reservoirs may count as a new C sink, the burial of terrestrial OC in reservoirs constitutes a new C sink only if the burial is more efficient in reservoirs than in other depositional environments. We carried out incubation experiments that mimicked the environmental conditions of different depositional environments along the land-sea continuum (oxic and anoxic freshwater, oxic and anoxic seawater, oxic river bedload, and atmosphere-exposed floodplain) to investigate whether reservoirs bury OC more efficiently compared to other depositional environments. For sediment OC predominantly of terrestrial origin, OC degradation rates were significantly lower, by a factor of 2, at anoxic freshwater and saltwater conditions compared to oxic freshwater and saltwater, river, and floodplain conditions. However, the transformation of predominantly terrestrial OC to methane was one order of magnitude higher in anoxic freshwater than at other conditions. For sediment OC predominantly of aquatic origin, OC degradation rates were uniformly high at all conditions, implying equally low burial efficiency of aquatic OC (76{\%} C loss in 57 days). Since anoxia is more common in reservoirs than in the coastal ocean, these results suggest that reservoirs are a depositional environment in which terrestrial OC is prone to become buried at higher efficiency than in the ocean but where also the terrestrial OC most efficiently is transformed to methane.},

It was found that FDA fluorescence values did not decrease in some stressed cells, demonstrating that the applicability of the method needs to be assessed further in the context of growth-influencing conditions. In the present study, changes of FDA fluorescence values were studied in bloom-forming cyanobacterial Microcystis aeruginosa Kutz cells under stress conditions such as nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) deficiency, or darkness and low temperature (10 degrees C), respectively. The results demonstrated that esterase activity decreased immediately in dark-stressed cells, which correlated with the decline of biomass and photosynthetic activity. Under the other three stress conditions, however, especially at low temperature, the cells lost photosynthetic activity but had the highest esterase activity, which was five times higher than the control group. These findings contrast with the assay criteria that the expression of a stain should reflect the change of photosynthetic activity and that stressed cells should have a lower staining intensity than the control cells. According to these results, the esterase activity response was dependent on environmental factors. Furthermore, higher fluorescence intensity did not mean higher metabolic activity, but a discrepant value indicated a severe stress.},

abstract = {CO2 emissions from inland waters are commonly determined by indirect methods that are based on the product of a gas transfer coefficient and the concentration gradient at the air water interface (e.g., wind-based gas transfer models). The measurements of concentration gradient are typically collected during the day in fair weather throughout the course of a year. Direct measurements of eddy covariance CO2 fluxes from a large inland water body (Ross Barnett reservoir, Mississippi, USA) show that CO2 effluxes at night are approximately 70{\%} greater than those during the day. At longer time scales, frequent synoptic weather events associated with extratropical cyclones induce CO2 flux pulses, resulting in further increase in annual CO2 effluxes by 16{\%}. Therefore, CO2 emission rates from this reservoir, if these diel and synoptic processes are under-sampled, are likely to be underestimated by approximately 40{\%}. Our results also indicate that the CO2 emission rates from global inland waters reported in the literature, when based on indirect methods, are likely underestimated. Field samplings and indirect modeling frameworks that estimate CO2 emissions should account for both daytime-nighttime efflux difference and enhanced emissions during synoptic weather events. The analysis here can guide carbon emission sampling to improve regional carbon estimates.},

abstract = {The Petit Saut Reservoir (French Guiana), flooded in 1994, has an anoxic and methane-rich ({\textgreater}400 $\mu$mol.L-1) hypolimnion and an oxycline located at around 5 meters depth. Waters passing through the turbines are enriched in CH4, which partly degasses downstream of the dam. Aerobic methane oxidation rates were measured in the waters of the reservoir epilimnion and, in river waters downstream of the dam, during the wet and dry seasons. A unique first order relationship between methane concentration (CCH4) and aerobic methane oxidation rates (CH4-ox) was found for the reservoir and the river downstream of the dam (CH4-ox = 0.11 ± 0.01 CCH4 + 1.18 ± 0.74) giving a specific CH4 oxidation rate of 0.11 ± 0.01 h-1. In the reservoir, depth-integrated methane oxidation rates were calculated from oxidation rates and the distributions of CH4 and oxygen and ranged between 11 ± 6 and 310 ± 132 mmol.m-2.d-1, consistent with the turbulent vertical flux from the hypolimnion (38-321 mmol.m-2.d-1) and almost two orders of magnitude higher than the atmospheric fluxes (0.3 ± 0.2-1.9 ± 1.2 mmol.m-2.d-1). The average integrated methane oxidation rate in the epilimnion given by these two independent methods is 100 ± 80 mmol.m-2.d-1. Downstream of the dam, about 40{\%} of the methane entering the river was oxidized (77 ± 40 mmol.m-2.d-1) and 50{\%} was emitted to the atmosphere (98 ± 28 mmol.m-2.d-1). Our results show that total pelagic oxidation (67 ± 64 Gg C-CH4.y-1) reduce atmospheric emissions by more than 85{\%} for the whole lake-river system and that this process is responsible for more than 25{\%} of total CO2 emissions from the whole reservoir-river system.

abstract = {Six reservoirs located in the Western United States (F. D. Roosevelt, Dworshak, Wallula, Shasta, Oroville, and New Melones) were sampled in order to estimate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Two types of fluxes were assessed: (1) diffusive fluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) at the air/water interface and (2) degassing fluxes of CH4 and CO2 from water passing through the turbine spillways. Diffusive flux measurements indicated that the surface of the reservoirs were a source of CH4 during the sampling period (from +3.2 to +9.5 mg CH4 m -2 d-1). Oroville (+1026 mg CO2 m-2 d-1) and Shasta (+1247 mg CO2 m -2 d-1) surfaces were also sources of CO 2. In contrast, the surface of all the other reservoirs constituted sinks for CO2 (from -349 to -1195 mg CO 2 m-2 d-1). Degassing fluxes ranged from +0.003 to +0.815 t CH4 d-1, and from +16 to +324 t CO2 d-1. Daily GHG budgets ranged from +0.146 to +2.228 t CH4 d-1, and from -15 to +224 t CO2 d-1. Degassing fluxes represented an important term of these budgets. A significant correlation was observed between the magnitude of CO2 diffusive fluxes and the water pH (R2 = 0.81; p {\textless} 0.0001). All other correlations between GHG diffusive fluxes and independent variables tested were weak and/or not significant. Finally, while attempting to resolve the spatial variability in diffusive fluxes, we were able to cluster reservoirs neither according to geological nor ecological criteria.

Through a combination of molecular techniques and process rate measurements, we showed that both sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation contribute to energy flux and elemental cycling in oxygen-free waters off the coast of northern Chile. These processes may have been overlooked because in nature, the sulfide produced by sulfate reduction immediately oxidizes back to sulfate. This cryptic sulfur cycle is linked to anammox and other nitrogen cycling processes, suggesting that it may influence biogeochemical cycling in the global ocean.},

Sulfate reduction rates determined as potential rates in anoxic sediment slurries showed a similar vertical distribution with the highest values in the anoxic zones. The highest cell numbers observed were 1.3 x 105 cells cm-3 with lactate as substrate. SRB were also found in oxic sediment layers in numbers similar to those detected in anoxic zones. From the highest positive MPN tubes 34 pure cultures were isolated. Physiological characterization including nutritional behaviour, tests for desulfoviridin and spore formation turned out that nearly all isolates belonged to the genera Desulfovibrio, Desulfomicrobium, and Desulfotomaculum. SRB from the oxic sediment layers revealed a higher oxygen tolerance and capacity of oxygen respiration than isolates from the anoxic sediment layers. However, no sulfate reduction was observed in the presence of oxygen, since oxygen was preferentially reduced.},

abstract = {The emission fluxes and the distribution of dissolved methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were determined for 11 sampling stations in two hydroelectric reservoirs (flooded since 1978 and 1993) located in the James Bay territory of northern Qu{\'{e}}bec. The measured benthic fluxes for the two greenhouse gases were found to be either higher or similar to those determined at the water‐air interface during the ice‐free sampling periods. For the 2 year duration of the study, emission fluxes of CH4 to the atmosphere generally varied between 5 and 10 mg m−2 d−1, while those for CO2 ranged from 500 to 1100 mg m−2 d−1. Furthermore, through the use of static chambers at the water‐air interface, we determined that the emission fluxes for the gases are controlled by molecular diffusion. Our calculated fluxes have been separated into two groups: (1) regular emission fluxes and (2) above‐average emission fluxes. The first type comprises the majority of fluxes measured during the sampling periods (i.e., 88{\%} for CH4 and 87{\%} for CO2). The second group reflects unusual sampling conditions (e.g., strong winds, water column depths of less than 1 m, or flooded peatland mats floating at the surface). Although data for this group are limited, our preliminary results suggest that they may be an important component in an atmospheric emissions budget for large reservoirs. Concentration profiles for CH4 and CO2 dissolved in the water column clearly show that oxidation and/or horizontal advection of these gases are controlling factors in their subsequent release to the atmosphere. Most of the CH4 is oxidized within the first 25 cm above the flooded soil‐water interface. Consequently, neither benthic emissions of CH4 and CO2 nor the type of flooded soil appear to control atmospheric emissions of these gases from hydroelectric reservoirs.

The highest chl a for both size fractions was observed in the Western Tropical Atlantic province (WTRA), while the lowest chl a was found in the upper mixed layer (UML) of the South Atlantic Tropical gyre (SATL). A similar pattern was found for carbon fixation. Within the SATL, the highest picophytoplankton contribution to total production was recorded at the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM), while the contribution of phytoplankton {\textgreater}2 $\mu$m was higher in the UML. Additionally, the relative contribution of large phytoplankton to total integrated primary production was higher than its contribution to total biomass. Both size fractions depicted maximum P/B and P/chl a in WTRA surface waters. In the SATL province, phytoplankton {\textgreater}2 $\mu$m showed the highest P/B and P/chl a along the UML, while picophytoplankton P/B and P/chl a peaked around the DCM.

abstract = {Rivers and marginal wetlands contribute significantly to the carbon (C) exchange rate per unit area compared to adjacent terrestrial ecosystems, due to high C inputs, metabolic activity and CO2 supersaturation. Within riverscapes, the contribution of emerging bottoms (i.e. parafluvial zones) and ephemeral vegetation (i.e. microphytobenthos or annual vascular plant communities) to the C metabolism is understudied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the CO2 exchange rates at the water- and emergent sand bar-atmosphere interfaces within a lowland large temperate river stretch. CO2 fluxes were measured seasonally, in summer (August 2007) and winter (March 2008) via static closed chambers, together with the primary producers' biomass (microphytobenthos and vascular macrophytes). Our results showed that the river was a CO2 source (between 0.2 and 7.6 mmol CO2 m−2 day−1), whilst the vegetated parafluvial zones acted as a net sink, with assimilation rates peaking at 623.4 mmol CO2 m−2 day−1. Emerging bare sediments were on the contrary net emitting CO2 systems (2.7–60.1 mmol CO2 m−2 day−1). Within lotic environments, seasonally emergent vegetated sand bars may represent important C fixation hot spots, with summer primary production particularly contributing to offsetting CO2 emissions and counterbalancing the heterotrophic metabolism of the saturated zones. Based on these outcomes, we suggest that studies addressing the strictly aquatic fluvial environment, which is generally a CO2 emitter, should be linked to those from transitional areas in order to better integrate terrestrial and aquatic C budgets.},

abstract = {Nitrogen loading from developed watersheds to aquatic ecosystems can stimulate microbial denitrification, a process that reduces nitrate (NO-3) to dinitrogen (N2) or nitrous oxide (N2O), the latter a potent greenhouse gas. While aquatic ecosystems are a globally significant source of N2O to the atmosphere, the relationship between denitrification and N2O production is not well known. Until recently, this field of research has been limited by the technical challenges of simultaneously measuring denitrification and N2O production or consumption in situ at the ecosystem scale. Here we use membrane inlet mass spectrometry, an analytical method providing precise and accurate measurements of dissolved N2, and gas chromatography to directly measure N2 and N2O concentrations in the hypolimnion of a stratified reservoir draining an agricultural watershed. Denitrification resulted in a consistent increase in dissolved N2 and decrease in NO-3concentrations in the hypolimnion during the 5 month period of stratification, though temporal patterns in dissolved N2O concentrations were less consistent. Denitrification alternated between an N2O source and sink, with the N2O yield, defined as the relative production of N2O to N2 via denitrification, ranging from -3.4{\%} (i.e., net N2O consumption) to 19.5{\%} (mean = -0.03{\%}). Whereas denitrification in the hypolimnion functioned as a small N2O sink during the stratified period, the reservoir was an N2O source on an annual time scale. Additional studies across reservoirs of different sizes, trophic status, and ages are needed to resolve the role of reservoirs in the global N2O budget. {\textcopyright} 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of phytoplankton community assembly is a fundamental issue of aquatic ecology. Here, we use field data from transitional (e.g. coastal lagoons) and coastal water environments to decode patterns of phytoplankton size distribution into organization and adaptive mechanisms. Transitional waters are characterized by higher resource availability and shallower well-mixed water column than coastal marine environments. Differences in physico-chemical regime between the two environments have been hypothesized to exert contrasting selective pressures on phytoplankton cell morphology (size and shape). We tested the hypothesis focusing on resource availability (nutrients and light) and mixed layer depth as ecological axes that define ecological niches of phytoplankton. We report fundamental differences in size distributions of marine and freshwater diatoms, with transitional water phytoplankton significantly smaller and with higher surface to volume ratio than marine species. Here, we hypothesize that mixing condition affecting size-dependent sinking may drive phytoplankton size and shape distributions. The interplay between shallow mixed layer depth and frequent and complete mixing of transitional waters may likely increase the competitive advantage of small phytoplankton limiting large cell fitness. The nutrient regime appears to explain the size distribution within both marine and transitional water environments, while it seem does not explain the pattern observed across the two environments. In addition, difference in light availability across the two environments appear do not explain the occurrence of asymmetric size distribution at each hierarchical level. We hypothesize that such competitive equilibria and adaptive strategies in resource exploitation may drive by organism's behavior which exploring patch resources in transitional and marine phytoplankton communities.},

abstract = {Small water bodies, such as temporary ponds, have a high carbon processing potential. Nevertheless, despite the global occurrence of these systems, the carbon effluxes from such water bodies have been largely overlooked. In this study, we examined the intra- and intersystem variability of carbon dioxide (CO2) effluxes from a set of Mediterranean temporary ponds during the flooding phase, a hot-spot for biogeochemical cycling in temporary systems. The CO2 effluxes showed higher variability among the various sections of each pond (i.e., inundated, emerged-unvegetated and emerged-vegetated) than among the ponds. The emerged-vegetated sections showed the highest CO2 effluxes per unit area and tended to drive the total effluxes at the whole-ecosystem scale. The mean CO2 efflux (121.3±138.1 mmol m–2 d–1) was in the upper range for freshwater ecosystems. The CO2 effluxes were not related to catchment properties but rather to the organic content of the sediments, especially in the emerged sections of the ponds.Our results indicate that temporary ponds, especially their emerged sections, are important sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, highlighting the need to include the dry phases of these and other temporary aquatic systems in regional carbon budgets.},

abstract = {Water-level fluctuations, often linked to seasonal climatic trends, are a natural phenomenon which occur in almost all aquatic ecosystems. In some climatic regions, as the Mediterranean one, they are particularly wide due to the occurrence of two well separated periods: the rainy winter and the almost completely dry summer. Precipitation is concentrated in the first period, whereas in the second strong evaporation losses take place. According to these climatic features, and to ensure a continuous supply of water throughout the year, man-made lakes store water during winter and are subjected to dewatering during summer to compensate the lack of precipitation. These ecosystems are thus characterised by rather wide water level fluctuations which were observed to transform them from potentially warm monomictic lakes into polymictic or atelomictic ones. These changes deeply affect the biological structure and the functions of the water bodies impairing the response of some ecosystem properties, as resilience and resistance, since the impacts are immense enough to move the systems out of their homeostatic plateau of, respectively, deep or shallow lakes. In order to understand to what extent a reservoir can be "emptied" without changing its ecosystemic identity (deep or shallow lake sensu Padis{\'{a}}k {\&} Reynolds, 2003) and to set a "dewatering threshold", the results from two different hydrological years, one with a dewatering so intense as to disrupt thermal stratification in midsummer, and the other one with water enough to allow the maintenance of the reservoir's thermal structure throughout the summer, are compared. Former investigations have shown that the persistence of thermal stratification has a positive value in Sicilian reservoirs: a notable decrease in total phytoplankton biomass and in the relative occurrence of cyanoprokaryotes was observed in the high-level year with a stable thermal stratification. Although the solving of the external load problems causing eutrophication phenomena remain the main task to improve the water quality of this Mediterranean island, a management procedure, based on the maintaining of the ecosystem within its homeostatic plateau through the setting of a dewatering threshold, is suggested. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

@article{Wolf-Gladrow2007,
abstract = {Total alkalinity (TA) is one of the few measurable quantities that can be used together with other quantities to calculate concentrations of species of the carbonate system (CO2, HCO3-, CO32-, H+, OH-). TA and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are conservative quantities with respect to mixing and changes in temperature and pressure and are, therefore, used in oceanic carbon cycle models. Thus it is important to understand the changes of TA due to various biogeochemical processes such as formation and remineralization of organic matter by microalgae, precipitation and dissolution of calcium carbonate. Unfortunately deriving such changes from the common expression for TA in terms of concentrations of non-conservative chemical species (HCO3-, CO32-, B(OH)4-, H+, OH-, etc.) is rarely obvious. Here an expression for TA (TAec) in terms of the total concentrations of certain major ions (Na+, Cl-, Ca2+ etc.) and the total concentrations of various acid-base species (total phosphate etc.) is derived from Dickson's original definition of TA under the constraint of electroneutrality. Changes of TA by various biogeochemical processes are easy to derive from this so-called explicit conservative expression for TA because each term in this expression is independent of changes of temperature or pressure within the ranges normally encountered in the ocean and obeys a linear mixing relation. Further, the constrains of electroneutrality for nutrient uptake by microalgae and photoautotrophs are discussed. A so-called nutrient-H+-compensation principle is proposed. This principle in combination with TAec allows one to make predictions for changes in TA due to uptake of nutrients that are consistent with observations. A new prediction based on this principle is the change in TA due to nitrogen fixation followed by remineralization of organic matter and subsequent nitrification of ammonia which implies a significant sink of TA in tropical and subtropical regions where most of the nitrogen fixation takes place. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

We used a metabolic scaling framework to investigate how body size and temperature influence phytoplankton community metabolism. We tested this framework using phytoplankton sampled from an outdoor mesocosm experiment, where communities had been either experimentally warmed ( + 4 ° C) for 10 years or left at ambient temperature. Warmed and ambient phytoplankton communities differed substantially in their taxonomic composition and size structure. Despite this, the response of primary production and community respiration to long- and short-term warming could be estimated using a model that accounted for the size- and temperature dependence of individual metabolism, and the community abundance-body size distribution. This work demonstrates that the key metabolic fluxes that determine the carbon balance of planktonic ecosystems can be approximated using metabolic scaling theory, with knowledge of the individual size distribution and environmental temperature.},

abstract = {The open-channel oxygen method for estimating stream metabolism avoids many of the problems associated with chamber techniques, but its uncertainty has not been rigorously quantified. Uncertainty in open-channel estimates of photosynthesis (P) and respiration (R) can be estimated by use of a Monte Carlo approach incorporating uncertainty in each of the terms (reaeration rate coefficient, range of temperature oscillation, midpoint temperature, travel time, metabolic rate, and precision of instrument calibration) affecting error in estimates of P and R. The distributions derived from the Monte Carlo simulations provide confidence limits for estimates of P and R. Use of this approach along with simulation of a range of stream conditions indicates that: 1) given equivalent metabolic rates and physical conditions, estimates of R are subject to greater than are estimates of P, especially in high-gradient streams, and 2) uncertainty can be minimized by special attention to the precision of measurement for factors affecting the saturation concentration of oxygen. Reasonable confidence limits (95{\%} CL within 30{\%} of mean) can be achieved for estimates of P where daily photosynthetic rates exceed 4 mg L-1d1, but in turbulent streams (k(20°) = 100/d), rates of R must be nearly 15 mg L-1d-1 to achieve similar precision.},

Because hydrography is one of the most important drivers in nutrient transport, it was essential to establish how climatic changes and direct human activities (primarily irrigation and reservoir operations) affect the hydrological cycle. Contemporary and future hydrography was established by applying a modified version of a global water balance and transport model (WBMplus) driven by present and future climate forcing, as described in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios (1970–2050). WBMplus represents a major upgrade to previous WBM implementations by incorporating irrigational water uptake and reservoir operations in a single modeling framework. Contemporary simulations were carried out by using both observed climate forcings from the Climate Research Unit of East Anglia (CRU) data sets and from Global Circulation Model (GCM) simulations that are comparable to the future simulations from the same GCM forcings. Future trends in three key human activities (land use, irrigation, and reservoirs operation for hydropower) were taken from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE). The reservoir operation required establishing a realistic distribution of future reservoirs since the IMAGE model provided only the hydropower potentials for the different future scenarios.},

abstract = {Robust appraisals of climate impacts at different levels of global-mean temperature increase are vital to guide assessments of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The 2015 Paris Agreement includes a two-headed temperature goal: "holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C". Despite the prominence of these two temperature limits, a comprehensive overview of the differences in climate impacts at these levels is still missing. Here we provide an assessment of key impacts of climate change at warming levels of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, including extreme weather events, water availability, agricultural yields, sea-level rise and risk of coral reef loss. Our results reveal substantial differences in impacts between a 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming that are highly relevant for the assessment of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5 °C increase in global-mean temperature marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions. Similarly, this warming difference is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs. In a scenario with an end-of-century warming of 2 °C, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards. This fraction is reduced to about 90 {\%} in 2050 and projected to decline to 70 {\%} by 2100 for a 1.5 °C scenario. Analyses of precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences and hot-spots of change emerge. Regional reduction in median water availability for the Mediterranean is found to nearly double from 9 {\%} to 17 {\%} between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, and the projected lengthening of regional dry spells increases from 7 to 11 {\%}. Projections for agricultural yields differ between crop types as well as world regions. While some (in particular high-latitude) regions may benefit, tropical regions like West Africa, South-East Asia, as well as Central and northern South America are projected to face substantial local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize. Best estimate sea-level rise projections based on two illustrative scenarios indicate a 50 cm rise by 2100 relative to year 2000-levels for a 2 °C scenario, and about 10 cm lower levels for a 1.5 °C scenario. In a 1.5 °C scenario, the rate of sea-level rise in 2100 would be reduced by about 30 {\%} compared to a 2 °C scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of regional differentiation to assess both future climate risks and different vulnerabilities to incremental increases in global-mean temperature. The article provides a consistent and comprehensive assessment of existing projections and a good basis for future work on refining our understanding of the difference between impacts at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming.},

abstract = {The emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from the Petit Saut hydroelectric reservoir (Sinnamary River, French Guiana) to the atmosphere were quantified for 10 years since impounding in 1994. Diffusive emissions from the reservoir surface were computed from direct flux measurements in 1994, 1995, and 2003 and from surface concentrations monitoring. Bubbling emissions, which occur only at water depths lower than 10 m, were interpolated from funnel measurements in 1994, 1997, and 2003. Degassing at the outlet of the dam downstream of the turbines was calculated from the difference in gas concentrations upstream and downstream of the dam and the turbined discharge. Diffusive emissions from the Sinnamary tidal river and estuary were quantified from direct flux measurements in 2003 and concentrations monitoring. Total carbon emissions were 0.37 ± 0.01 Mt yr-1 C (CO2 emissions, 0.30 ± 0.02; CH4 emissions, 0.07 ± 0.01) the first 3 years after impounding (1994-1996) and then decreased to 0.12 ± 0.01 Mt yr-1 C (CO2, 0.10 ± 0-01; CH4, 0.016 ± 0.006) since 2000. On average over the 10 years, 61{\%} of the CO2 emissions occurred by diffusion from the reservoir surface, 31{\%} from the estuary, 7{\%} by degassing at the outlet of the dam, and a negligible fraction by bubbling. CH4 diffusion and bubbling from the reservoir surface were predominant (40{\%} and 44{\%}, respectively) only the first year after impounding. Since 1995, degassing at an aerating weir downstream of the turbines has become the major pathway for CH4 emissions, reaching 70{\%} of the total CH4 flux. In 2003, river carbon inputs were balanced by carbon outputs to the ocean and were about 3 times lower than the atmospheric flux, which suggests that 10 years after impounding, the flooded terrestrial carbon is still the predominant contributor to the gaseous emissions. In 10 years, about 22{\%} of the 10 Mt C flooded was lost to the atmosphere. Our results confirm the significance of greenhouse gas emissions from tropical reservoir but stress the importance of: (1) considering all the gas pathways upstream and downstream of the dams and (2) taking into account the reservoir age when upscaling emissions rates at the global scale.

Mediterranean reservoirs are very dynamic systems, subject to frequent changes in the physical environment as a result of water management operations, which suggests that phytoplankton communities might also undergo frequent changes. The phytoplankton community composition, abundance and seasonal dynamics of El Gergal, a medium-size Mediterranean reservoir, is analyzed and interpreted in terms of changes in the nutrient-energy balance. It is demonstrated that the seasonal scale changes in the physical environment trigger the seasonal predictable autogenic dynamics of the phytoplankton community. In addition, frequent short-term external perturbations of the physical environment may also induce allogenic shifts and reversions in the succession. The physical changes occur mainly as a result of variations in the outflows. Results are discussed in terms of phytoplankton functional groups life cycle strategies and water quality management.},

abstract = {Methane (CH4) emissions from reservoirs are responsible for most of the atmospheric climatic forcing of these aquatic ecosystems, comparable to emissions from paddies or biomass burning. Primarily, CH4 is produced during the anaerobic mineralization of organic carbon in anoxic sediments by methanogenic archaea. However, the origin of the recurrent and ubiquitous CH4 supersaturation in oxic waters (i.e., the methane paradox) is still controversial. Here, we determined the dissolved CH4 concentration in the water column of 12 reservoirs during summer stratification and winter mixing to explore CH4 sources in oxic waters. Reservoir sizes ranged from 1.18 to 26.13 km2. We found that dissolved CH4 in the water column varied by up to 4 orders of magnitude (0.02-213.64 ?mol L1), and all oxic depths were consistently supersaturated in both periods. Phytoplanktonic sources appear to determine the concentration of CH4 in these reservoirs primarily. In anoxic waters, the depth-cumulative chlorophyll a concentration, a proxy for the phytoplanktonic biomass exported to sediments, was correlated to CH4 concentration. In oxic waters, the photosynthetic picoeukaryotes abundance was significantly correlated to the dissolved CH4 concentration during both the stratification and the mixing. The mean depth of the reservoirs, as a surrogate of the vertical CH4 transport from sediment to the oxic waters, also contributed notably to the CH4 concentration in oxic waters. Our findings suggest that photosynthetic picoeukaryotes can play a significant role in determining CH4 concentration in oxic waters, although their role as CH4 sources to explain the methane paradox has been poorly explored.},

abstract = {Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is critical for controlling the flux of methane from anoxic environments. AOM coupled to iron, manganese and sulphate reduction have been demonstrated in consortia containing anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea. More recently it has been shown that the bacterium Candidatus 'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' can couple AOM to nitrite reduction through an intra-aerobic methane oxidation pathway. Bioreactors capable of AOM coupled to denitrification have resulted in the enrichment of 'M. oxyfera' and a novel ANME lineage, ANME-2d. However, as 'M. oxyfera' can independently couple AOM to denitrification, the role of ANME-2d in the process is unresolved. Here, a bioreactor fed with nitrate, ammonium and methane was dominated by a single ANME-2d population performing nitrate-driven AOM. Metagenomic, single-cell genomic and metatranscriptomic analyses combined with bioreactor performance and 13 C- and 15 N-labelling experiments show that ANME-2d is capable of independent AOM through reverse methanogenesis using nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Comparative analyses reveal that the genes for nitrate reduction were transferred laterally from a bacterial donor, suggesting selection for this novel process within ANME-2d. Nitrite produced by ANME-2d is reduced to dinitrogen gas through a syntrophic relationship with an anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacterium, effectively outcompeting 'M. oxyfera' in the system. We propose the name Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' for the ANME-2d population and the family Candidatus 'Methanoperedenaceae' for the ANME-2d lineage. We predict that 'M. nitroreducens' and other members of the 'Methanoperedenaceae' have an important role in linking the global carbon and nitrogen cycles in anoxic environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 °C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

These models have used various approaches to predict sediment storage at broad scales from very limited data sets. Here, we report a large-scale direct assessment of the standing stock and sedimentation rate of C for a representative set of lakes in Finland. The 122 lakes were selected from the statistically selected Nordic Lake Survey database, they cover the entire country and the water quality represents the average lake water quality in Finland. Unlike all prior estimates, these data use sediment cores that comprise the entire sediment record. The data show that within Finland, aquatic ecosystems contain the second largest areal C stocks (19 kg Cm-2 ) after peatlands (72 kg Cm-2 ), and exceed by significant amounts stocks in the forest soil (uppermost 75 cm; 7.2 kg Cm-2 ) and woody biomass (3.4 kg Cm -2).

abstract = {The magnitude of stream and river carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is affected by seasonal changes in watershed biogeochemistry and hydrology. Global estimates of this flux are, however, uncertain, relying on calculated values for CO2 and lacking spatial accuracy or seasonal variations critical for understanding macroecosystem controls of the flux. Here, we compiled 5,910 direct measurements of fluvial CO2 partial pressure and modeled them against watershed properties to resolve reach-scale monthly variations of the flux. The direct measurements were then combined with seasonally resolved gas transfer velocity and river surface area estimates from a recent global hydrography dataset to constrain the flux at the monthly scale. Globally, fluvial CO2 emission varies between 112 and 209 Tg of carbon per month. The monthly flux varies much more in Arctic and northern temperate rivers than in tropical and southern temperate rivers (coefficient of variation: 46 to 95 vs. 6 to 12{\%}). Annual fluvial CO2 emission to terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) ratio is highly variable across regions, ranging from negligible ({\textless}0.2{\%}) to 18{\%}. Nonlinear regressions suggest a saturating increase in GPP and a nonsaturating, steeper increase in fluvial CO2 emission with discharge across regions, which leads to higher percentages of GPP being shunted into rivers for evasion in wetter regions. This highlights the importance of hydrology, in particular water throughput, in routing terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere via the global drainage networks. Our results suggest the need to account for the differential hydrological responses of terrestrial-atmospheric vs. fluvial-atmospheric carbon exchanges in plumbing the terrestrial carbon budget.},

The sulfate reduction rate under anaerobic conditions was 370 nmol of SO42- mg of protein-1 min-1. At the onset of aerobic gassing, sulfate reduction decreased by 40{\%}, although viable cell numbers did not decrease. After 42 h, the sulfate reduction rate returned to the level observed in the anaerobic culture. At this stage the growth yield increased by 180{\%} compared to the anaerobic culture to 4.4 g of protein per mol of sulfate reduced. Protein content per cell increased at the same time by 40{\%}. The oxygen consumption rate per milligram of protein measured in washed cell suspensions increased by 80{\%}, and the thiosulfate reduction rate of the same samples increased by 29{\%} with lactate as the electron donor. These findings indicated possible oxygen-dependent enhancement of growth. After 140 h of growth under oxygen flux, formation of cell aggregates 0.1 to 3 mm in diameter was observed. Micrometer-sized aggregates were found to form earlier, during the first hours of exposure to oxygen. The respiration rate of D. oxyclinae was sufficient to create anoxia inside clumps larger than 3 $\mu$m, while the levels of dissolved oxygen in the growth vessel were 0.7 ± 0.5 $\mu$M. Aggregation of sulfate-reducing bacteria was observed within a Microcoleus chthonoplastes-dominated layer of a cyanobacterial mat under daily exposure to oxygen concentrations of up to 900 $\mu$M. Desulfonema-like sulfate-reducing bacteria were also common in this environment along with other nonaggregated sulfate-reducing bacteria. Two-dimensional mapping of sulfate reduction showed heterogeneity of sulfate reduction activity in this oxic zone.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of hydrography on benthic-pelagic coupling in a transitional inner continental shelf area. From Oct 2009 to Jul 2012, we measured sediment oxygen demand (SOD), benthic inorganic nutrient fluxes, and sediment characteristics (e.g. chl a and phaeopigment content, grain size, etc.) in two regions of the Southern New England continental shelf: a relatively well mixed ecosystem (Block Island Sound, BIS), and an adjacent, seasonally stratified ecosystem (Rhode Island Sound, RIS). Despite a higher rate of euphotic zone primary production in BIS, benthic metabolism (measured as SOD) was notsignificantly different between the two areas (BIS=953.8±88.2{\$}\mu{\$}molm-2h-1; RIS=912.2±69.1{\$}\mu{\$}molm-2h-1). We speculate that the similarity of SOD at these two sites was due to differences in water column hydrography between the Sounds, where the energetic water column mixing in BIS could potentially resuspend organic matter back to the water column to be decomposed before reaching the benthos. Additionally, we think that the seasonal presence of a strong pycnocline in RIS prevented mixing of regenerated DIN and DIP to surface waters for use by phytoplankton. Apparent differences in benthic macrofaunal abundance between Block Island Sound and Rhode Island Sound translated to differences in dissolved inorganic nutrient fluxes between the two areas. Excretion and irrigation activities by the dense amphipod communities in BIS likely caused higher effluxes of DIN (NH4+=36.9±7.7{\$}\mu{\$}molm-2 h-1; NOX=23.5±3.4{\$}\mu{\$}molm-2h-1) and DIP (7.2±1.4{\$}\mu{\$}molm-2h-1) compared to fluxes in RIS (NH4+=22.8±4.5{\$}\mu{\$}molm-2h-1; NOX=11.1±5.5{\$}\mu{\$}molm-2h-1; DIP=3.2±0.8{\$}\mu{\$}molm-2h-1).

abstract = {We investigated the importance of meteorological and lake physical conditions for temporal, horizontal and vertical differences in the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) and water temperature, and the derived daily estimates of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP). Our study was conducted in a subtropical and polymictic lake in Southern Brazil, during a spring–summer transition. Metabolic rates were determined from two sites using the open water oxygen technique. At the central deep site, oxygen sondes were deployed at three depths to assess patterns in vertical variability. During 10 days, an additional DO and temperature sonde was placed near the shoreline allowing us to compare metabolic differences in the surface layers between the central pelagic and littoral site. While GPP was similar, R was significantly higher at the shallower littoral site, causing NEP to be lower, although NEP was still positive. The littoral site had less diel changes in DO and higher daily variability in all metabolic rates. Variability in GPP and R at the littoral site was related to temperature, wind speed and rainfall suggesting that short-term variability in metabolic rates in shallow areas are sensitive to resuspension of sediments caused by a less stable water column. A clear vertical gradient was furthermore found for the metabolic rates at the central deep part of the lake, related to the light extinction, with highest GPP around 0.3m and decreasing with depth, while respiration showed the inverse pattern. Below subsurface, respiration prevailed at 5.0m depth and was uncoupled to primary production. Under conditions with high light and temperature, and low wind speeds, the mixing depth became shallower, in turn increasing the water column stability at the deep pelagic site, which resulted in higher mean light available and higher GPP in the water column. Our results confirm that deployment of sensors in different sites and depths allows for spatially, as well as temporally more representative estimates of lake metabolism.},

abstract = {Goal, Scope and Background. Humans now strongly influence almost every major aquatic ecosystem, and their activities have dramatically altered the fluxes of growth-limiting nutrients from the landscape to receiving waters. Unfortunately, these nutrient inputs have had profound negative effects upon the quality of surface waters worldwide. This review examines how eutrophication influences the biomass and species composition of algae in both freshwater and costal marine systems. Main Features. An overview of recent advances in algae-related eutrophication research is presented. In freshwater systems, a summary is presented for lakes and reservoirs; streams and rivers; and wetlands. A brief summary is also presented for estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems. Results. Eutrophication causes predictable increases in the biomass of algae in lakes and reservoirs; streams and rivers; wetlands; and coastal marine ecosystems. As in lakes, the response of suspended algae in large rivers to changes in nutrient loading may be hysteretic in some cases. The inhibitory effects of high concentrations of inorganic suspended solids on algal growth, which can be very evident in many reservoirs receiving high inputs of suspended soils, also potentially may occur in turbid rivers. Consistent and predictable eutrophication-caused increases in cyanobacterial dominance of phytoplankton have been reported worldwide for natural lakes, and similar trends are reported here both for phytoplankton in turbid reservoirs, and for suspended algae in a large river. Conclusions. A remarkable unity is evident in the global response of algal biomass to nitrogen and phosphorus availability in lakes and reservoirs; wetlands; streams and rivers; and coastal marine waters. The species composition of algal communities inhabiting the water column appears to respond similarly to nutrient loading, whether in lakes, reservoirs, or rivers. As is true of freshwater ecosystems, the recent literature suggests that coastal marine ecosystems will respond positively to nutrient loading control efforts. Recommendations and Outlook. Our understanding of freshwater eutrophication and its effects on algal-related water quality is strong and is advancing rapidly. However, our understanding of the effects of eutrophication on estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems is much more limited, and this gap represents an important future research need. Although coastal systems can be hydrologically complex, the biomass of marine phytoplankton nonetheless appears to respond sensitively and predictably to changes in the external supplies of nitrogen and phosphorus. These responses suggest that efforts to manage nutrient inputs to the seas will result in significant improvements in coastal zone water quality. Additional new efforts should be made to develop models that quantitatively link ecosystem-level responses to nutrient loading in both freshwater and marine systems.},

abstract = {In the coming decades and centuries, the ocean's biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems will become increasingly stressed by at least three independent factors. Rising temperatures, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation will cause substantial changes in the physical, chemical and biological environment, which will then affect the ocean's biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems in ways that we are only beginning to fathom. Ocean warming will not only affect organisms and biogeochemical cycles directly, but will also increase upper ocean stratification. The changes in the ocean's carbonate chemistry induced by the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO(2)) (i.e. ocean acidification) will probably affect many organisms and processes, although in ways that are currently not well understood. Ocean deoxygenation, i.e. the loss of dissolved oxygen (O(2)) from the ocean, is bound to occur in a warming and more stratified ocean, causing stress to macro-organisms that critically depend on sufficient levels of oxygen. These three stressors-warming, acidification and deoxygenation-will tend to operate globally, although with distinct regional differences. The impacts of ocean acidification tend to be strongest in the high latitudes, whereas the low-oxygen regions of the low latitudes are most vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation. Specific regions, such as the eastern boundary upwelling systems, will be strongly affected by all three stressors, making them potential hotspots for change. Of additional concern are synergistic effects, such as ocean acidification-induced changes in the type and magnitude of the organic matter exported to the ocean's interior, which then might cause substantial changes in the oxygen concentration there. Ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation are essentially irreversible on centennial time scales, i.e. once these changes have occurred, it will take centuries for the ocean to recover. With the emission of CO(2) being the primary driver behind all three stressors, the primary mitigation strategy is to reduce these emissions.},

abstract = {The Mediterranean reservoirs receive frequent atmospheric Saharan dust inputs with soil-derived organic components mostly during the stratification periods, when run-off inputs are particularly limited. Here, we quantified and optically characterized the water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) of the (dry and wet) atmospheric deposition in collectors placed near three reservoirs from the western Mediterranean Basin. In addition, we determined the WSOC contribution to the pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the reservoirs and the influence of dust-derived chromophoric organic components on the water transparency during their stratification periods. We found synchronous dynamics in the WSOC atmospheric inputs among the three collectors and in the DOC concentrations among the three reservoirs. The DOC concentrations and the WSOC atmospheric inputs were positive and significantly correlated in the most oligotrophic reservoir (Qu{\'{e}}ntar) and in the reservoir with the highest ratio of surface area to mixing water depth (Cubillas). Despite these correlations, WSOC atmospheric inputs represented less than 10{\%} of the total DOC pool, suggesting that indirect effects of dust inputs on reservoir DOC may also promote these synchronous patterns observed in the reservoirs. Chromophoric components from dust inputs can significantly reduce the water transparency to the ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The depths where UVR at {\&}lambda; Combining double low line 320 nm was reduced to ten percent of surface intensity ( Z 10{\%}) decreased 27 cm in B{\'{e}}znar, 49 cm in Cubillas, and 69 cm in Qu{\'{e}}ntar due to the dust inputs. Therefore, the increasing dust export to the atmosphere may have consequences for the water transparency of aquatic ecosystems located under the influence of the global dust belt. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {Methanogenesis has traditionally been assumed to occur only in anoxic environments, yet there is mounting, albeit indirect, evidence of methane (CH4) production in oxic marine and freshwaters. Here we present the first direct, ecosystem-scale demonstration of methanogenesis in oxic lake waters. This methanogenesis appears to be driven by acetoclastic production, and is closely linked to algal dynamics. We show that oxic water methanogenesis is a significant component of the overall CH4 budget in a small, shallow lake, and provide evidence that this pathway may be the main CH4 source in large, deep lakes and open oceans. Our results challenge the current global understanding of aquatic CH4 dynamics, and suggest a hitherto unestablished link between pelagic CH4 emissions and surface-water primary production. This link may be particularly sensitive to widespread and increasing human influences on aquatic ecosystem primary productivity.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Long-term and seasonal changes in production and respiration were surveyed in the Valle de Bravo reservoir, Mexico, in a period during which high water-level fluctuations occurred (2006–2015). We assessed the community metabolism through oxygen dynamics in this monomictic water-body affected by strong diurnal winds. The multiple-year data series allowed relationships with some environmental drivers to be identified, revealing that water level-fluctuations strongly influenced gross primary production and respiratory rates. Production and respiration changed mainly vertically, clearly in relation to light availability. Gross primary production ranged from 0.15 to 1.26 gO {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}  m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}  h {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} , respiration rate from −0.13 to −0.83 gO {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}  m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}  h {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and net primary production from −0.36 to 0.66 gO {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}   m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}  h  {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} within the production layer, which had a mean depth of 5.9 m during the stratification periods and of 6.8 m during the circulations. The greater depth of the mixing layer allowed the consumption of oxygen below the production layer even during the stratifications, when it averaged 10.1 m. Respiration below the production layer ranged from −0.23 to −1.38 gO {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} h {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} . Vertically integrated metabolic rates (per unit area) showed their greatest variations at the intra-annual scale (stratification-circulation). Gross primary production and Secchi depth decreased as the mean water level decreased between stratification periods. VB is a highly productive ecosystem; its gross primary production averaged 3.60 gC m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}  d {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} during the 10 years sampled, a rate similar to that of hypertrophic systems. About 45{\%} of this production, an annual average net carbon production of 599 g C m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}  year {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} , was exported to the hypolimnion, but on the average 58{\%} of this net production was recycled through respiration below the production layer. Overall, only 19{\%} of the carbon fixed in VB is buried in the sediments. Total ecosystem respiration rates averaged −6.89 gC  m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}  d {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} during 2006–2015, doubling the gross production rates. The reservoir as a whole exhibited a net heterotrophic balance continuously during the decade sampled, which means it has likely been a net carbon source, potentially releasing an average of 3.29 gC m {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}  d {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to the atmosphere. These results are in accordance with recent findings that tropical eutrophic aquatic ecosystems can be stronger carbon sources than would be extrapolated from temperate systems, and can help guide future reassessments on the contribution of tropical lakes and reservoirs to carbon cycles at the global scale. Respiration was positively correlated with temperature both for the stratification periods and among the circulations, suggesting that the contribution of C to the atmosphere may increase as the reservoirs and lakes warm up owing to climate change and as their water level is reduced through intensification of their use as water sources. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our analysis suggests that proportions of dissolved silica (Si), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in rivers carrying nutrients of anthropogenic origin, as well as in the coastal waters strongly influenced by those rivers, have changed historically in a way that now closely approximates the Redfield ratio (Si:N:P=16:16:1). It is likely that coastal phytoplankton productivity has increased under these favourable nutrient conditions and was accompanied by an increasing incidence of noxious phytoplankton blooms and bottom water hypoxia. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Monthly sampling was carried out during a 2-year study (2003-2004) in order to analyse benthic microalgal composition, abundance (ABU) and biomass (BIOM). Temperature and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) at the bottom were recorded during sampling. In the overlying water nitrite (NO2-), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), phosphate (PO43-) and silicate (SiO3-) were analysed. The sediment consisted of 8.2{\%} sand, 18.3{\%} clay and 73.5{\%} silt. BIOM showed its maximum in August 2004, while the minimum was recorded in October 2003. The microphytobenthic community was mainly composed of diatoms. Among all the 103 Bacillariophyceae taxa identified in the sediment, we distinguished 67 benthic, 8 epiphytic and 8 planktonic species. Among diatoms Nitzschia and Navicula were the most abundant genera (30.8 and 26.2{\%}, respectively). The linear regression between total diatom ABU and PAR was statistically significant (r = 0.66, p {\textless} 0.001). A seasonal pattern of monthly samplings was highlighted both from cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). The latter revealed two diatom assemblages: a winter assemblage and a spring-summer one. The genera Diploneis and Pinnularia showed an inverse relation against temperature. Considering the nutrient ratios the development of microphytobenthos (MPB) appeared to be potentially co-limited by Si and P almost throughout the study period. A clear inverse relation between NO2-, NO3- and BIOM was emphasised by the moving average and the PCA. The inverse relation among nutrients and light availability suggested that the photosynthetic activity of benthic diatoms in spring and summer may be one of the processes controlling sediment-water nutrient fluxes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A brief description is given of the derivation of the basic thermodynamic relations and expressions are given for the specific heat, elastic moduli, and magnetic susceptibility, all obtained on the basis of the Fermi-liquid approach without the conventionally used model assumptions. The application of the theory presented here to the description of the role of the interelectronic interaction in thermodynamic phenomena in systems with hybridized electronic states, formed by impurity donor resonance levels in the conduction band of a crystal, is examined. A formulation of an equation for the spontaneous localized spin magnetic moment in hybridized states is also presented. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Giorgi2008,
abstract = {We present a review of climate change projections over the Mediterranean region based on the most recent and comprehensive ensembles of global and regional climate change simulations completed as part of international collaborative projects. A robust and consistent picture of climate change over the Mediterranean emerges, consisting of a pronounced decrease in precipitation, especially in the warm season, except for the northern Mediterranean areas (e.g. the Alps) in winter. This drying is due to increased anticyclonic circulation that yields increasingly stable conditions and is associated with a northward shift of the Atlantic storm track. A pronounced warming is also projected, maximum in the summer season. Inter-annual variability is projected to mostly increase especially in summer, which, along with the mean warming, would lead to a greater occurrence of extremely high temperature events. The projections by the global and regional model simulations are generally consistent with each other at the broad scale. However, the precipitation change signal produced by the regional models shows substantial orographically-induced fine scale structure absent in the global models. Overall, these change signals are robust across forcing scenarios and future time periods, with the magnitude of the signal increasing with the intensity of the forcing. The intensity and robustness of the climate change signals produced by a range of global and regional climate models suggest that the Mediterranean might be an especially vulnerable region to global change. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {Significant improvements have been made in estimating gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respira- tion (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP) from diel, “free-water” changes in dissolved oxygen (DO). Here we evaluate some of the assumptions and uncertainties that are still embedded in the technique and provide guide- lines on how to estimate reliable metabolic rates from high-frequency sonde data. True whole-system estimates are often not obtained because measurements reflect an unknown zone of influence which varies over space and time. A minimum logging frequency of 30 min was sufficient to capture metabolism at the daily time scale. Higher sampling frequencies capture additional pattern in the DO data, primarily related to physical mixing. Causes behind the often large daily variability are discussed and evaluated for an oligotrophic and a eutrophic lake. Despite a 3-fold higher day-to-day variability in absolute GPP rates in the eutrophic lake, both lakes required at least 3 sonde days per week for GPP estimates to be within 20{\%} of the weekly average. A sensitivity analysis evaluated uncertainties associated with DO measurements, piston velocity (k), and the assumption that daytime R equals nighttime R. In low productivity lakes, uncertainty in DO measurements and piston velocity strongly impacts R but has no effect on GPP or NEP. Lack of accounting for higher R during the day underestimates R and GPP but has no effect on NEP. We finally provide suggestions for future research to improve the technique.},

However, sparse long-term monitoring of lake ecosystems has prevented reconstruction of global hypoxia dynamics while inhibiting investigations into its causes and assessing the resilience capacity of these systems. This study compiles the onset and duration of hypoxia recorded in sediments of 365 lakes worldwide since AD 1700, showing that lacustrine hypoxia started spreading before AD 1900, 70 years prior to hypoxia in coastal zones. This study also shows that the increase of human activities and nutrient release is leading to hypoxia onset. No correlations were found with changes in precipitation or temperature. There is no evidence for a post-1980s return to well-oxygenated lacustrine conditions in industrialized countries despite the implementation of restoration programs. The apparent establishment of stable hypoxic conditions prior to AD 1900 highlights the challenges of a growing nutrient demand, accompanied by increasing global nutrient emissions of our industrialized societies, and climate change.},

Insights from this retrospective analysis are used to evaluate management alternatives for the remediation of oxygen resources and redox conditions. Reduced byproducts of anaerobic metabolism accumulated annually in the hypolimnion, causing low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the upper waters during fall turnover. The high natural sulfate (SO4 2−) concentration of the lake promoted DO depletion and the production of methylmercury (CH3Hg+). Severe depletions of DO occurred annually in the upper waters during fall mixing, representing violations of water quality standards for extended intervals from 1978 to 1996. Depletions of DO during fall were less severe from 1997 to 2004. The improvement is reported to be in response to: (1) more routine occurrence of spring turnover following c...},

Most countries have separate methods for macrophytes and phytobenthos in rivers; however, the situation is very different for lakes. Here, 16 countries do not have dedicated phytobenthos methods, some include filamentous algae within macrophyte survey methods whilst others use diatoms as proxies for phytobenthos. The most widely-cited justification for not having a dedicated phytobenthos method is redundancy, i.e. that macrophyte and phytoplankton assessments alone are sufficient to detect nutrient impacts. Evidence from those European Union Member States that have dedicated phytobenthos methods supports this for high level overviews of lake condition and classification; however, there are a number of situations where phytobenthos may contribute valuable information for the management of lakes.},

abstract = {For more than three-quarters of a century it has been assumed that basal metabolic rate increases as body mass raised to some power p. However, there is no broad consensus regarding the value of p: whereas many studies have asserted that p is 3/4 (refs 1-4; 'Kleiber's law'), some have argued that it is 2/3 (refs 5-7), and others have found that it varies depending on factors like environment and taxonomy. Here we show that the relationship between mass and metabolic rate has convex curvature on a logarithmic scale, and is therefore not a pure power law, even after accounting for body temperature. This finding has several consequences. First, it provides an explanation for the puzzling variability in estimates of p, settling a long-standing debate. Second, it constitutes a stringent test for theories of metabolic scaling. A widely debated model based on vascular system architecture fails this test, and we suggest modifications that could bring it into compliance with the observed curvature. Third, it raises the intriguing question of whether the scaling relation limits body size.},

We show that the average simulated phytoplankton biomass derived from three different aquatic ecosystem models is generally superior to any of the three individual models in describing observed phytoplankton biomass in a typical temperate lake ecosystem, and we simulate a series of climate change projections. While this is the first multi-model ensemble approach applied for some of the most complex aquatic ecosystem models available, we consider it sets a precedent for what will become commonplace methodology in the future, as it enables increased robustness of model projections, and scenario uncertainty estimation due to differences in model structures.},

abstract = {Here we construct a fundamental mathematical theory of population dynamics in the context of the normalized spectra of abundance and biomass of plankton. The theory begins with the distribution function of abundance as a function of individual body weight and growth rate, and the law of the conservation of mass. The basic governing equations for population growth and biomass production are then deduced without empirical assumptions. The governing equations represent the fundamental mass balance between the biomass flux from small to large sizes due to individual growth and the sum of sources and sinks such as birth, death and mortality. The slope of the normalized biomass spectrum at steady state is proved to be approximately equal to the ratio of the intrinsic rate of increase in abundance to individual weight-specific growth rate. We demonstrated that measurements of biomass spectra in nature can be used to estimate population-dynamics parameters of individual growth rate and the intrinsic rate of increase. We further apply this population dynamics theory to data collected by an Optical Plankton Counter in the California Current region during June and July, 1993. These data cover a range in the marine biomass spectrum from 100 to 104 µg C individual body weight.},

abstract = {Methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, is produced in and emitted from lakes at globally significant rates. The drivers controlling the proportion of produced CH4 that will reach the atmosphere, however, are still not well understood. We sampled a small eutrophic lake (Soppensee, Switzerland) in 2016–2017 for CH4 concentrations profiles and emissions, combined with water column hydrodynamics to investigate the fate of CH4 produced in hypolimnetic sediments. Using a mass balance approach for the periods between April and October of both years, net CH4 production rates in hypolimnetic sediments ranged between 11.4 and 17.7 mmol m−2 d−1, of which 66–88{\%} was stored in the hypolimnion, 13–27{\%} was diffused to the epilimnion, and 6–7{\%} left the sediments via ebullition. Combining these results with a process-based model we show that water column turbulent diffusivity (Kz) had a major influence on the fate of produced CH4 in the sediments, where higher Kz values potentially lead to greater proportion being oxidized and lower Kz lead to a greater proportion being stored. During fall when the water column mixes, we found that a greater proportion of stored CH4 is emitted if the lake mixes rapidly, whereas a greater proportion will be oxidized if the water column mixes more gradually. This work highlights the central role of lake hydrodynamics in regulating CH4 dynamics and further suggests the potential for CH4 production and emissions to be sensitive to climate-driven alterations in lake mixing regimes and stratification.},

abstract = {Lakes and impoundments are an important source of methane (CH 4 ), a potent greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere. A recent analysis shows aquatic productivity (i.e., eutrophication) is an important driver of CH 4 emissions from lentic waters. Considering that aquatic productivity will increase over the next century due to climate change and a growing human population, a concomitant increase in aquatic CH 4 emissions may occur. We simulate the eutrophication of lentic waters under scenarios of future nutrient loading to inland waters and show that enhanced eutrophication of lakes and impoundments will substantially increase CH 4 emissions from these systems (+30–90{\%}) over the next century. This increased CH 4 emission has an atmospheric impact of 1.7–2.6 Pg C-CO 2 -eq y −1 , which is equivalent to 18–33{\%} of annual CO 2 emissions from burning fossil fuels. Thus, it is not only important to limit eutrophication to preserve fragile water supplies, but also to avoid acceleration of climate change.},

abstract = {The uptake of nitrate or ammonium (at a concentration of 10 pmol l-1) by marine phytoplankton was studied in relation to cell size. Initial specific nitrate uptake rates by small (35000 $\mu$m3) and large (130000 $\mu$m3) cells of the diatom Ditylum brightwellii did not differ significantly. However, the larger cells maintained a high uptake rate for a longer time. Therefore, they accumulated nitrate in a higher biomass-specific pool than the smaller cells. In the dark, this effect was even more pronounced. Two smaller diatom species, Lauderia borealis (7474 $\mu$m3) and Thalassiosira pseudonana (98 $\mu$m3), had lower initial specific nitrate uptake rates and lower intracellular pools. Transient-state ammonium uptake did not result in accumulation of large intracellular pools of ammonium. Theoretically, and on the basis of the presented results, we stress the dualistic functional role of the vacuole. A large vacuole is an effective way for larger algal species to possess a minimum cell nutrient quota/cell surface ratio which is in the range of smaller species. Furthermore, by functioning as a storage reservoir it reduces inhibition of the uptake rate by cytoplasmic accumulated nutrients. The effect of the latter mechanism is that larger algal species are better at nitrate uptake under fluctuating conditions. These results imply that, in nitrogen-controlled marine systems, resource competition under fluctuating nutrient concentrations can only lead to a shift towards larger phytoplankton species if nitrate rather than ammonium is the main nitrogen source. From theoretical considerations it is argued that the maximum growth rate of algae is determined by nutrient assimilation properties rather than by photosynthetic capacity.},

abstract = {Vertical turbulent diffusivity (Kz), which can be estimated from water temperature, is a key factor in the evolution of water quality in lentic waters. In this study, we analysed the capability of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (EFDC) to capture water temperature and vertical diffusivity in Lake Arendsee in the Northern German plain. Of particular interest to us is to evaluate the model performance for capturing the diffusion minimum within the metalimnion and analyse the response of the metalimnetic Kz to meteorological forcing, namely changing wind speed and warming. The comparison confirmed that the calibrated model could reproduce both stratification dynamics and vertical diffusion profiles in the lake. The model was also shown to be able to capture the duration and vertical extent of the metalimnetic diffusion minimum. The scenario results illustrate that, compared to air temperature, wind velocity appeared to be the more influential meteorological variable on the vertical exchange within the metalimnion. While increasing wind velocities mostly affected the minimum values of Kz in the metalimnion and thus led to intensified vertical exchange, the reduction of wind velocity mostly affected the depth of minimal Kz, but not its absolute value.},

abstract = {The distribution and composition of phytoplankton assemblages were studied in the Nazar{\'{e}} submarine canyon, during an upwelling event, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment analysis, complemented by microscopic qualitative observations. High chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were recorded in the canyon head, near the coast, where values greater than 4$\mu$gL-1were observed. In contrast, Chl a was relatively low in offshore regions, with values below 0.5$\mu$gL-1. The most abundant accessory pigments were fucoxanthin, peridinin, diadinoxanthin and 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin. Pigment data information was analyzed using the CHEMTAX software to estimate the contribution of different taxonomic groups to total Chl a. North of the canyon head, an area with high concentration of peridinin-containing dinoflagellates was identified (with presence of chain-forming toxic dinoflagellates). The presence of these organisms was associated with mixed water columns and phosphate values lower than the ones south of the canyon head, where a dominance of diatoms was recorded. The rest of the study region showed a dominance of prymnesiophytes and a significant contribution of cyanobacteria at oceanic stations. This study demonstrates the usefulness of using pigment analysis to study spatial distribution of phytoplankton groups in relation to a complex physical environment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Inputs of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to lakes derived from the surrounding landscape can be stored, mineralized or passed to downstream ecosystems. The balance among these OC fates depends on a suite of physical, chemical, and biological processes within the lake, as well as the degree of recalcintrance of the allochthonous DOC load. The relative importance of these processes has not been well quantified due to the complex nature of lakes, as well as challenges in scaling DOC degradation experiments under controlled conditions to the whole lake scale. We used a coupled hydrodynamic-water quality model to simulate broad ranges in lake area and DOC, two characteristics important to processing allochthonous carbon through their influences on lake temperature, mixing depth and hydrology. We calibrated the model to four lakes from the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research site, and simulated an additional 12 ‘hypothetical' lakes to fill the gradients in lake size and DOC concentration. For each lake, we tested several mineralization rates (range: 0.001 d−1 to 0.010 d−1) representative of the range found in the literature. We found that mineralization rates at the ecosystem scale were roughly half the values from laboratory experiments, due to relatively cool water temperatures and other lake-specific factors that influence water temperature and hydrologic residence time. Results from simulations indicated that the fate of allochthonous DOC was controlled primarily by the mineralization rate and the hydrologic residence time. Lakes with residence times {\textless}1 year exported approximately 60{\%} of the DOC, whereas lakes with residence times {\textgreater}6 years mineralized approximately 60{\%} of the DOC. DOC fate in lakes can be determined with a few relatively easily measured factors, such as lake morphometry, residence time, and temperature, assuming we know the recalcitrance of the DOC.},

abstract = {The universal temperature dependence of metabolic rates has been used to predict how ocean biology will respond to ocean warming. Determining the temperature sensitivity of phytoplankton metabolism and growth is of special importance because this group of organisms is responsible for nearly half of global primary production, sustains most marine food webs, and contributes to regulate the exchange of CO2 between the ocean and the atmosphere. Phytoplankton growth rates increase with temperature under optimal growth conditions in the laboratory, but it is unclear whether the same degree of temperature dependence exists in nature, where resources are often limiting. Here we use concurrent measurements of phytoplankton biomass and carbon fixation rates in polar, temperate and tropical regions to determine the role of temperature and resource supply in controlling the large-scale variability of in situ metabolic rates. We identify a biogeographic pattern in phytoplankton metabolic rates, which increase from the oligotrophic subtropical gyres to temperate regions and then coastal waters. Variability in phytoplankton growth is driven by changes in resource supply and appears to be independent of seawater temperature. The lack of temperature sensitivity of realized phytoplankton growth is consistent with the limited applicability of Arrhenius enzymatic kinetics when substrate concentrations are low. Our results suggest that, due to widespread resource limitation in the ocean, the direct effect of sea surface warming upon phytoplankton growth and productivity may be smaller than anticipated.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton growth and productivity relies on light, multiple nutrients and temperature. These combined factors constitute the 'integrated growth environment'. Since their emergence in the Archaean ocean, phytoplankton have experienced dramatic shifts in their integrated growth environment and, in response, evolved diverse mechanisms to maximize growth by optimizing the allocation of photosynthetic resources (ATP and NADPH) among all cellular processes. Consequently, co-limitation has become an omnipresent condition in the global ocean. Here we focus on evolved phytoplankton populations of the contemporary ocean and the varied energetic pathways they employ to solve the optimization problem of resource supply and demand. Central to this discussion is the allocation of reductant formed through photosynthesis, which we propose has the following three primary fates: carbon fixation, direct use and ATP generation. Investment of reductant among these three sinks is tied to cell cycle events, differentially influenced by specific forms of nutrient stress, and a strong determinant of relationships between light-harvesting (pigment), photosynthetic electron transport and carbon fixation. Global implications of optimization are illustrated by deconvolving trends in the 10-year global satellite chlorophyll record into contributions from biomass and physiology, thereby providing a unique perspective on the dynamic nature of surface phytoplankton populations and their link to climate.},

Seven species associations are recognised by R-mode cluster analysis of total (live plus dead) foraminiferal faunal data. Mangrove forest and salt meadow below MHWS (mean high water spring level), in near normal salinity marshes (Kaipara, Miranda), are dominated by an Ammonia association with subsidiary Elphidium excavatum, Haplophragmoides- Miliamminafusca, and Helenina associations. In less saline marshes (Pauatahanui), the salt meadow and rush marsh below MHWS, are dominated by a Haplophragmoides- Miliamminafusca association. In all transects, the narrow zone between MHWS and EHWS (extreme high water spring level) is dominated ({\textgreater}90{\%} relative abundance) by a Trochammina association (7! inflata, T. macrescens, Miliammina obliqua). A palimpsest, Ammonia-dominated, exposed beach fauna on the penultimate chenier interferes with the recognition of this high tidal Trochammina zone in one Miranda transect. Dependent upon their proximity to exposed sea conditions and fast-flowing tidal channels, there are variable numbers of introduced foraminiferal tests (Cornuspira association) in the marshes at all levels. At Pauatahanui, a monospecific fauna of T. macrescens is present just at EHWS (upper 0.1 m of tidal range). This has been recognised previously only in northeast America and may provide the most accurate paleo-sea level marker known. There appear to be no significant tide-related trends in diversity, but in all transects there is a marked abundance peak between MHWS and EHWS levels, which if recognised in fossil faunas could also be useful in determining previous sea-level heights.},

abstract = {We used data collected from 1989 to 2009 from 151 shallow (mean depth {\textless} 3 m) temperate lakes in Denmark to explore the influence of lake trophic status, surface area and catchment size on the seasonal dynamics of the air-water flux of CO 2. Monthly CO 2 fluxes were derived from measurements of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), pH, ionic strength, temperature, and wind speed. CO 2 fluxes exhibited large seasonal variability, in particular in oligo-mesotrophic lakes. Most of the lakes emitted CO 2 during winter (median rates ranging 300-1,900 mg C m -2day -1), and less CO 2 during summer or, in the case of some of the highly eutrophic lakes, retained CO 2 during summer. We found that seasonal CO 2 fluxes were strongly negatively correlated with pH (r = -0.65, P {\textless}0.01), which in turn was correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations (r = 0.48, P {\textless}0.01). Our analysis suggests that lake trophic status (a proxy for pelagic production) interacts with the lake ANC to drive the seasonal dynamics of CO 2 fluxes, largely by changing pH and thereby the equilibrium of the free CO 2 and bicarbonate relation. Long-term observations from four lakes, which have all undergone a period of oligotrophication during the past two decades, provide further evidence that CO 2 efflux generally increases as trophic status decreases, as a consequence of decreased pH. Across these four lakes, the annual average CO 2 emission has increased by 32{\%} during the past two decades, thus, demonstrating the strong link between lake trophic status and CO 2 flux. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {A set of methodological tools were tested in order to assess the eutrophication quality of selected coastal areas in Eastern Mediterranean Sea, Greece, in the context of the Water Framework Directive under various anthropogenic pressures. Three, five-step tools, namely, TRIX, chlorophyll-a (chl-a) biomass classification scheme, and eutrophication index (E.I.) were applied in oligotrophic waters for (a) the whole water column and (b) the euphotic zone. The relationship among the eutrophication assessment indices and the ecological quality status (EcoQ) assessment indices for benthic macroinvertebrates (BENTIX index) and macroalgae (ecological evaluation index-EEIc) was also explored. Agricultural activities and mariculture are the pressures mostly related to the eutrophication assessment of the selected Greek coastal water bodies. Chl-a proved to be the criterion with the best overall correlation with the EcoQ indices, while TRIX with the lowest. Moreover, among the eutrophication indices, E.I. showed better overall agreement with BENTIX showing that probably it reflects the indirect relation of macroinvertebrates with water eutrophication in a better way. Among the eutrophication indices used, TRIX rather overestimated the eutrophication status of the selected coastal areas. The first stage of eutrophication was reflected more efficiently using E.I. than TRIX, but E.I. seems to be a rather sensitive index. A future modification of the high to good boundary of E.I. may be needed in order to demonstrate the high status of the relatively undisturbed Greek coastal sites.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Methane (CH {\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} ) transport from organic-rich fine-grained (muddy) shallow aquatic sediments to water column is mediated dominantly by discrete bubbles, which is an important natural source of greenhouse CH {\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} . The lifespan of these bubbles within the sediment comprises two successive stages: growth from nucleation up to a mature size and then buoyant ascent toward the sediment–water interface. Bubbles often experience an oscillating overburden load due to the passage of winds and/or storm-induced short period surface waves or long-period tides, which can potentially affect both stages of the bubble's lifespan. However, little is known about the wave effects over bubble growth phase. In the present work, this subject is investigated using a numerical single-bubble mechanical/solute transport model, which quantifies the effects of different parameters (amplitude and period) of the wave loading and of the water depth, over the bubble growth pattern in sediments and its specific characteristics. It was found that bubbles induce early sediment fracturing in the presence of waves, attributed to the low overburden load appearing at wave troughs. Bubbles at shallow depth rapidly grow at wave troughs by inducing multiple intense fracturing events. However, this ability decreases with an increasing water depth because of a slower solute influx. In the presence of waves, bubbles mature in shorter time, whose contrast to the no wave case is controlled by the ratio of wave amplitude to equilibrium water depth. Due to the higher frequency of occurrence of wave troughs for shorter-period waves, bubble growth is accelerated compared with the case of longer-period waves. Overall, our modeling suggests that the fastest bubble growth can be predicted for higher amplitude, short-period waves traveling in shallow water. We further infer that accelerated bubble growth, along with subsequent wave-induced ascent can sufficiently shorten the bubble's total lifespan in sediment, which explains the observed episodic {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in situ{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ebullitions correlated with wind- or storm-induced waves. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These data have been obtained from the GlobColour project; the temporal coverage extends from September 1997 to December 2010. In this study we develop a generic quantitative approach for describing the temporal variability in the shape of the winter-spring bloom within a region. Variability in both the timing and magnitude of the bloom in the basin has been evaluated as a function of physical properties in the water column such as Mixed Layer Depth (MLD, GODAS model), sea surface temperature (SST, from AVHRR radiometers), photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR, from ocean color data) and euphotic depth (Zeu, from ocean color data). The analysis indicated that the timing, size and duration of the phytoplankton bloom in this area are largely controlled by both meteorological and oceanographic conditions at different scales; this means that it is likely to vary widely from one year to another.},

abstract = {Gas ebullition of river impoundments plays an increasingly significant role, particularly in transporting methane CH 4 from their sediments to the atmosphere, and contributing to the global carbon budget and global warming. Quantifying stochastic and episodic nature of gas ebullition is complicated espe-cially when conventionally conducted by using coverage-limited gas traps. Current knowledge of seasonality in a reservoir's gas ebullition is lacking in the literature. For this reason, advanced acoustic surveying was intensively applied to determine spatiotemporal distributions of gas ebullition in a European water-storage reservoir for two years. Additionally, the sampling was accompanied with gas collecting for analyzing gas composition. The gas released from the reservoir was primarily composed of CH 4 (on average 52{\%}, up to 94{\%}). The longitudinal distribution of gas ebullition was mainly determined by a proximity to the river inflow as a source of organic matter. A magnitude of ebullitive fluxes within the reservoir varied up to 1,300 mL m 22 d 21 (30 mmol CH 4 m 22 d 21). The most significant period of ebullition has turned out to be in fall, on average reaching a sevenfold ebullitive flux (70 mL m 22 d 21 , 1.6 mmol CH 4 m 22 d 21) higher than in the rest of the season. A substantial contribution to the fall peak was induced by an expansion of gas ebullition into greater depths, covering two thirds of the reservoir in late fall. The study demonstrates that the ebullitive fluxes of the temperate water storage reservoir were correlated to season, depth, and inflow proximity.},

abstract = {Decades of conflicting results have fueled a debate about how O 2 affects organic matter (OM) degradation and carbon cycling. In a laboratory study, using both OM taken directly from a humic lake and chemically isolated fulvic acid, we monitored the mineralization of dissolved OM in freshwater under purely oxic and anoxic conditions, under oxic then anoxic conditions, and under anoxic then oxic conditions, for 426 d. Between 5{\%} and 24{\%} of the initial OM was mineralized, with most extensive mineralization occurring under purely oxic and anoxic-oxic conditions. A sequential change in the O2 regime did not result in greater overall degradation, but initially anoxic conditions favored subsequent oxic mineralization. A substantially greater fraction of the OM was degraded than in previous shorter studies, with as much as 50{\%} of the total OM degradation occurring after 147 d into the experiment. Three fractions of the degradable OM were identified: OM degraded only under oxic conditions (68-78{\%}), OM degraded more rapidly under anoxic conditions than under oxic conditions (16-18{\%}), and OM degraded at equal rates under both oxic and anoxic conditions (6-14{\%}). The degradation patterns of natural dissolved OM from a humic lake and chemically isolated fulvic acid were very similar, which indicates a similar level of bioavailability. The difference between anoxic and oxic degradation was greater in our long-term studies than in previous short-term experiments, which indicates that the oxic and anoxic degradation potentials vary with increasing overall OM recalcitrance and that similar oxic and anoxic degradation rates can be expected in short-term experiments in which {\textless}30{\%} of the long-term degradable OM is allowed to decompose.},

abstract = {Ebullition (bubbling) from small lakes and ponds at high latitudes is an important yet unconstrained source of atmospheric methane (CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). Small water bodies are most abundant in permanently frozen peatlands, and it is speculated that their emissions will increase as the permafrost thaws. We made 6806 measurements of CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ebullition during four consecutive summers using a total of 40 bubble traps that were systematically distributed across the depth zones of three lakes in a sporadic permafrost landscape in northernmost Sweden. We identified significant spatial and temporal variations in ebullition and observed a large spread in the bubbles' CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} concentration, ranging from 0.04{\%} to 98.6{\%}. Ebullition followed lake temperatures, and releases were significantly larger during periods with decreasing atmospheric pressure. Although shallow zone ebullition dominated the seasonal bubble CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} flux, we found a shift in the depth dependency towards higher fluxes from intermediate and deep zones in early fall. The average daily flux of 13.4 mg CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} was lower than those measured in most other high-latitude lakes. Locally, however, our study lakes are a substantial CH {\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} source; we estimate that 350 kg of CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is released via ebullition during summer (June-September), which is approximately 40{\%} of total whole year emissions from the nearby peatland. In order to capture the large variability and to accurately scale lake CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ebullition temporally and spatially, frequent measurements over long time periods are critical.

abstract = {The fluxes of CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere, and the relative contributions of ebullition and molecular diffusion, were determined for a small hypertrophic freshwater lake (Priest Pot, U.K.) over the period May to October 1997. The average total flux of CH4 and CO2 (estimated from 7 sites on the lake) was approximately 52 mmol m-2 d-1 and was apportioned 12 and 40 mmol m-2 d-1 to CH4 and CO2 respectively. Diffusion across the air-water interface accounted for the loss of 0.4 and 40 mmol m-2 d-1 of CH4 and CO2 respectively whilst the corresponding figures for ebullition losses were 12.0 (CH4) and 0.23 (CO2) mmol m-2 d-1. Most CH4 (96{\%}) was lost by ebullition, and most CO2 (99{\%}) by diffusive processes. The ebullition of gas, measured at weekly intervals along a transect of the lake, showed high spatial and temporal variation. The CH4 content of the trapped gas varied between 44 and 88{\%} (by volume) and was highest at the deepest points. Pulses of gas ebullition were detected during periods of rapidly falling barometric pressure. The relevance of the measurements to global estimates of carbon emission from freshwaters are discussed.},

Comparisons with conventional fossil, nuclear and other renewable generation systems are also presented, in order to put the GHG emissions of wind and hydro power in perspective. Studies on GHG emissions from wind and hydro power show large variations in GHG emissions, varying from 0.2 to 152g CO2-equivalents per kWh. The main parameters affecting GHG emissions are also discussed in this article, in relation to these variations. The wide ranging results indicate a need for stricter standardised rules and requirements for life-cycle assessments (LCAs), in order to differentiate between variations due to methodological disparities and those due to real differences in performance of the plants. Since LCAs are resource- and time-intensive, development of generic GHG results for each technology could be an alternative to developing specific data for each plant. This would require the definition of typical parameters for each technology, for example a typical capacity factor for wind power. Such generic data would be useful in documenting GHG emissions from electricity generation for electricity trading purposes.},

abstract = {Peatlands in Zoige Plateau contains more than half of peatland carbon stock in China. This part of carbon is losing with climate change through dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, both of which are vulnerable to the environmental changes, especially on the Zoige Plateau with a pace of twice the observed rate of global climate warming. This research aimed to understand how climate change including soil warming, rainfall reduction and water table change affect CO2emissions and whether the trends of changes in CO2emission are consistent with those of pore water DOC concentration. A mesocosm experiment was designed to investigate the CO2emission and pore water DOC during the growing seasons of 2009–2010 under scenarios of passive soil warming, 20{\%} rainfall reduction and changes to the water table levels. The results showed a positive relationship between CO2emission and DOC concentration. For single factor effect, we found no significant relationship between water table and CO2emission or DOC concentration. However, temperature at 5 cm depth was found to have positive linear relationship with CO2emission and DOC concentration. The combined effect of soil warming and rainfall reduction increased CO2emission by 96.8{\%}. It suggested that the drying and warming could stimulate potential emission of CO2. Extending this result to the entire peatland area in Zoige Plateau translates into 0.45 Tg CO2emission per year over a growing season. These results suggested that the dryer and warmer Zoige Plateau will increase CO2emission. We also found the contribution rate of DOC concentration to CO2emission was increased by 12.1{\%} in the surface layer and decreased by 13.8{\%} in the subsurface layer with combined treatment of soil warming and rainfall reduction, which indicated that the warmer and dryer environmental conditions stimulate surface peat decomposition process.},

abstract = {Reservoirs are a globally significant source of methane (CH4), although most measurements have been made in tropical and boreal systems draining undeveloped watersheds. To assess the magnitude of CH4 emissions from reservoirs in midlatitude agricultural regions, we measured CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates from William H. Harsha Lake (Ohio, U.S.A.), an agricultural impacted reservoir, over a 13 month period. The reservoir was a strong source of CH4 throughout the year, emitting on average 176 ± 36 mg C m-2 d-1, the highest reservoir CH4 emissions profile documented in the United States to date. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the largest CH4 emissions were during summer stratified conditions, not during fall turnover. The river-reservoir transition zone emitted CH4 at rates an order of magnitude higher than the rest of the reservoir, and total carbon emissions (i.e., CH4 + CO2) were also greater at the transition zone, indicating that the river delta supported greater carbon mineralization rates than elsewhere. Midlatitude agricultural impacted reservoirs may be a larger source of CH4 to the atmosphere than currently recognized, particularly if river deltas are consistent CH4 hot spots.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A 2 year study of the phytoplankton community was carried out in the Indian River Lagoon, USA. In terms of biovolume, the phytoplankton community was generally dominated by dinoflagellates, diatoms or cyanobacteria. Mean phytoplankton standing crops were highest in the most flow-restricted regions of the lagoon, which had the lowest mean salinity values and comparatively high total nitrogen:total phosphorus ratios. In this region, blooms of dinoflagellates were common in the first year of the study, which was characterized by an El Nin ˜o event that yielded exceptionally high rainfall levels and freshwater outflow. Picoplanktonic cyanobacteria blooms became more prominent in the second year of the study, which was characterized by below average rainfall conditions. In unrestricted flow regions of the lagoon, located near inlets to the Atlantic Ocean, diatoms were most often the dominant taxa. Regions of intermediate water turnover rates and high external loading of phosphorus had a prevalence of diatom blooms. However, the average phytoplankton standing crops in the latter regions did not reach the levels experienced in the flow-restricted parts of the lagoon. In terms of individual phytoplankton taxa, the most common bloom-forming diatoms in the Indian River Lagoon system included: Skeletonema costatum, Dactyliosolen fragilissimus, Skeletonema menzelii, Cerataulina pelagica, Odontella regia, Chaetoceros lorenzianus, Rhizosolenia setigera and Thalassionema nitzschioides. The major bloom-forming dinoflagellate species included: Pheopolykrikos hartmannii, Akashiwo sanguinea, Prorocentrum micans, the potentially toxic species Pyrodinium bahamense var. bahamense and Prorocentrum minimum. Several picoplanktonic cyanobacteria were also prominent members of the phytoplankton community, including Synechococcus elongates. The spatial and temporal patterns observed in some of these dominant species were attributable to patterns in key environmental variables, including salinity, temperature and nutrient concentrations.

abstract = {The coastal zone is where land, ocean, and atmosphere interact. It exhibits a wide diversity of geomorphological types and ecosystems, each one displaying great variability in terms of physical and biogeochemical forcings. Despite its relatively modest surface area, the coastal zone plays a considerable role in the biogeochemical cycles because it receives massive inputs of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients, is among the most geochemically and biologically active areas of the biosphere, and exchanges large amounts of matter and energy with the open ocean. Coastal ecosystems have therefore attracted much attention recently and are the focus of several current national and international research programs (e.g. LOICZ, ELOISE). The primary production, respiration, calcification, carbon burial and exchange with adjacent systems, including the atmosphere, are reviewed for the major coastal ecosystems (estuaries, macrophyte communities, mangroves, coral reefs, and the remaining continental shelf). All ecosystems examined, except estuaries, are net autotrophic. The contribution of the coastal zone to the global carbon cycle both during pristine times and at present is difficult to assess due to the limited metabolic data available as well as because of major uncertainties concerning the magnitude of processes such as respiration, exchanges at the open ocean boundary, and air-sea fluxes of biogases.},

abstract = {Temperature strongly affects phytoplankton growth rates, but its effect on communities and ecosystem processes is debated. Because phytoplankton are often limited by light, temperature should change commu- nity structure if it affects the traits that determine competition for light. Furthermore, the aggregate response of phytoplankton communities to temperature will depend on how changes in community structure scale up to bulk rates. Here, we synthesize experiments on 57 phytoplankton species to analyze how the growth- irradiance relationship changes with temperature. We find that light-limited growth, light-saturated growth, and the optimal irradiance for growth are all highly sensitive to temperature. Within a species, these traits are co-adapted to similar temperature optima, but light-limitation reduces a species' temperature optimum by ?58C, which may be an adaptation to how light and temperature covary with depth or reflect underlying physiological correlations. Importantly, the maximum achievable growth rate increases with temperature under light saturation, but not under strong light limitation. This implies that light limitation diminishes the temperature sensitivity of bulk phytoplankton growth, even though community structure will be temperature-sensitive. Using a database of primary production incubations, we show that this prediction is consistent with estimates of bulk phytoplankton growth across gradients of temperature and irradiance in the ocean. These results indicate that interactions between temperature and resource limitation will be fun- damental for explaining how phytoplankton communities and biogeochemical processes vary across temper- ature gradients and respond to global change.

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions are important, but poorly quantified, components of riverine carbon (C) budgets. This is largely because the data needed for gas flux calculations are sparse and are spatially and temporally variable. Additionally, the importance of C gas emissions relative to lateral C exports is not well known because gaseous and aqueous fluxes are not commonly measured on the same rivers. We couple measurements of aqueous CO2 and CH4 partial pressures (pCO2, pCH4) and flux across the water-air interface with gas transfer models to calculate subbasin distributions of gas flux density. We then combine those flux densities with remote and direct observations of stream and river water surface area and ice duration, to calculate C gas emissions from flowing waters throughout the Yukon River basin. CO2 emissions were 7.68 Tg C yr-1 (95{\%} CI: 5.84 -10.46), averaging 750 g C m -2 yr-1 normalized to water surface area, and 9.0 g C m-2 yr-1 normalized to river basin area. River CH 4 emissions totaled 55 Gg C yr-1 or 0.7{\%} of the total mass of C emitted as CO2 plus CH4 and ∼6.4{\%} of their combined radiative forcing. When combined with lateral inorganic plus organic C exports to below head of tide, C gas emissions comprised 50{\%} of total C exported by the Yukon River and its tributaries. River CO2 and CH4 derive from multiple sources, including groundwater, surface water runoff, carbonate equilibrium reactions, and benthic and water column microbial processing of organic C. The exact role of each of these processes is not yet quantified in the overall river C budget.},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of light, nutrients, and organic matter on gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP 5 GPP 2 R) in a dystrophic forest lake and an open eutrophic lake. Forest vegetation reduced incoming irradiance (20{\%}) and wind speed (34{\%}) in dystrophic Gribs{\o}, having thermal stratification 1 month longer than in eutrophic Slotss{\o}. While Gribs{\o} had nutrient-limited phytoplankton during most of the year, Slotss{\o} only experienced nutrient depletion during algal blooms. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorbed most light (average 82{\%}) in dystrophic Gribs{\o}, while phytoplankton and other particles absorbed most light (45{\%}) in eutrophic Slotss{\o}. GPP and NEP were positively related to irradiance in both lakes. However, because of higher CDOM absorbance, three times more light was needed to attain autotrophy in Gribs{\o}, being net heterotrophic (NEP , 0) for 79{\%}of all days, compared to 59{\%}in Slotss{\o}. This difference vanished when NEP was scaled to light absorption by pigments, although the eutrophic lake maintained a higher photon yield. Metabolic rates varied much more in Slotss{\o}, where higher light and nutrient availability facilitated occasional phytoplankton blooms, while low light and nutrient availability in Gribs{\o} dampened temporal variability. Both lakes were annually net heterotrophic with similar annual areal rates (NEP, 214 mol C m22). Net heterotrophy in dystrophic Gribs{\o} derives from high import of organic carbon-rich water, while heterotrophy in eutrophic Slotss{\o} is fueled by degradation of sediment pools of organic matter accumulated under previous hypereutrophic conditions, emphasizing the importance of lake history on the contemporary metabolic state.},

abstract = {Summer blooms of large, filamentous, nitrogen-fixing and potentially toxic cyanobacteria are characteristic of many productive, warm monomictic reservoirs in the Mediterranean region, where they constitute stable assemblages. The accumulation of positively buoyant cyanobacteria at the surface layers of the water column favours – among others – the interception of light, inorganic carbon and nitrogen fluxes from the atmosphere, giving these prokaryotes a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton groups. Cyanobacterial blooms can cause deleterious effects to water quality and reservoir ecosystem services. Although the structure of the plankton community in reservoirs during cyanobacterial blooms is a well-known limnological issue, few studies have been undertaken on its functional characteristics. In this study, we used a high-resolution autonomous monitoring system to investigate the short-term changes in gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP) and community respiration (R) in the near-surface waters of a Mediterranean reservoir during a dense summer cyanobacterial bloom. Our results demonstrate that during the bloom, the surface waters of the reservoir showed a well-balanced planktonic metabolism, with a mean GPP:R ratio not significantly different than 1 and therefore close positive correlations between GPP and R. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the daily integrated incident light and the NEP:GPP ratio, while the mixed-layer depth and NEP:GPP ratio were negatively correlated, suggesting a central role for physical processes in the control of community metabolism and the persistence of the cyanobacterial bloom. The implications for the bloom stability and relevance for reservoir water quality management are noted.},

Here we show that an old, temperate reservoir acts simultaneously as a strong OC sink and CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} source, because the high sedimentation rate supplies reactive organic matter to deep, anoxic sediment strata, fuelling methanogenesis and gas bubble emission (ebullition) of CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} from the sediment.

abstract = {The study uses a GCM (ECHAM-OPYC3) and the association between the atmospheric circulation at 925 and 500 hPa and the distribution of daily precipitation for Mediterranean Spain (from earlier analyses) to give estimates of the probable annual precipitation for the late twenty first century. A down-scaling technique is used which involves the matching of daily circulation output from the model for a sequence of years in the late twentieth century (1971-90) and for a corresponding period in the late twenty first century (2080-99) to derive probable regional atmospheric pattern (AP) frequencies for this latter period, and thence to estimate likely changes in annual precipitation. Model days are classified by searching for the closest analogue amongst 19 previously identified APs from an earlier study. Future annual precipitation distribution is derived using previously established relationships between circulation type and daily precipitation distribution. Predicted AP frequencies and precipitation amounts and distribution are compensated by comparing model output with ECMWF data for a decade (1984-93) within the 1971-90 sequence, so that the analysis also provides a verification of the performance of the model. In general the agreement between model output and actual AP frequencies is very good for the present day, though for this southerly region the model appears slightly to under-estimate the frequency of easterly type circulations, many of which yield some of the most significant autumn severe storm rainfalls along the Mediterranean coast. The model tends to over-estimate the frequency of westerly type situations. The study utilises a 'moving window' technique in an attempt to derive measures of inter-decadal variability within the two 20 year periods. This avoids use of data from outside the periods, which would incorporate changing AP frequencies during a period of sustained climate change. Quite pronounced changes in frequency are indicated for certain APs. Marked decreases in frequency are indicated for many near-surface circulations with a westerly or northerly component. For APs with an easterly component, some are shown to increase, others to decrease. Increases in inter-decadal variability are strongly indicated for most APs, though for some easterly situations there is no clear signal. A significant annual precipitation reduction of between 6 to 14{\%} is indicated for Andaluc{\'{i}}ua and the upland parts of Catalu{\~{n}}a. In contrast, there is an increase in annual totals of up to 14{\%} along parts of the coast between Almer{\'{i}}a and the French border.},

However, the lack of statistical and bioinformatics tools to parallel recent high-throughput technological advancements has hindered this technology from reaching its full potential. We propose a flexible statistical model-based clustering approach for identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data based on t-mixture models with a Box-Cox transformation. This approach generalizes the popular Gaussian mixture models to account for outliers and allow for nonelliptical clusters. We describe an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously handle parameter estimation and transformation selection. Using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology provides enough flexibility and robustness to mimic manual gating results performed by an expert researcher. In addition, we present results from a simulation study, which show that this new clustering framework gives better results in terms of robustness to model misspecification and estimation of the number of clusters, compared to the popular mixture models. The proposed clustering methodology is well adapted to automated analysis of flow cytometry data. It tends to give more reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in manual gating analysis.},

abstract = {The 2018 edition of the United Nations World Water Development Report stated that nearly 6 billion peoples will suffer from clean water scarcity by 2050. This is the result of increasing demand for water, reduction of water resources, and increasing pollution of water, driven by dramatic population and economic growth. It is suggested that this number may be an underestimation, and scarcity of clean water by 2050 may be worse as the effects of the three drivers of water scarcity, as well as of unequal growth, accessibility and needs, are underrated. While the report promotes the spontaneous adoption of nature-based-solutions within an unconstrained population and economic expansion, there is an urgent need to regulate demography and economy, while enforcing clear rules to limit pollution, preserve aquifers and save water, equally applying everywhere. The aim of this paper is to highlight the inter-linkage in between population and economic growth and water demand, resources and pollution, that ultimately drive water scarcity, and the relevance of these aspects in local, rather than global, perspective, with a view to stimulating debate.},

abstract = {Depth variable vertical eddy diffusion coefficients for heat (Kz) were calculated from continuously measured temperature profiles in {\"{U}}berlinger See (western part of Lake Constance). The temperatures were averaged over vertical intervals of 10 m yielding 14 discrete values (maximum depth of {\"{U}}berlinger See: 147 m). A linear fit from 10 June to 29 September 1987 was used to smooth the significant temperature fluctuations caused by internal seiches of Lake Constance. Assuming horizontal homogeneity for the smoothed data the Gradient-Flux-Method was applied to compute vertical diffusion coefficients Kz at different depths using the depth variable volumes and surfaces of the 14 layers. The resulting mean diffusion coefficients for the period from June to September are 0.04 cm2/s near the thermocline and up to 0.8 cm2/s in deeper strata (accuracy: ± 50{\%}). It is shown that horizontal mixing between {\"{U}}berlinger See and Obersee (main lake) alters the computation of Kz by less than 50{\%}. A relationship between Kz and stability (Brunt-V{\"{a}}is{\"{a}}l{\"{a}}) frequency N is found which corresponds well to the theory of internal wave induced turbulence. Combining the diffusion coefficients with measured phosphorus profiles, a phosphorus flux from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion of (0.7 ± 0.4) mg P m-2 d-1 was calculated, corresponding to about 20{\%} of the average external loading per area of Lake Constance in 1986. {\textcopyright} 1990 Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag.},

abstract = {We measured in situ hypolimnion and metalimnion dinitrogen (N2) accumulation rates and N2 production from sediments in contact with the reservoir epilimnia for 3 small ({\textless} 1 km2) and shallow reservoirs with inherently low stratification stability. Hypolimnion areal denitrification rates ranged from 98.6 to 168 $\mu$mol N2-N m-2 h-1, while metalimnion rates were up to two times greater. A laboratory experiment simulating the temporary breakdown and reestablishment of the oxycline confirmed that short-term metalimnetic denitrification could be important in reactive nitrogen (N) loss in these reservoirs. Net denitrification occurred in sediments in contact with reservoir epilimnia during seasonal mixing, but net N2 fixation occurred in these sediments during stratification. The observed shift between net denitrification and net N2 fixation in epilimnetic sediments corresponded with an annual cycle of nitrate availability in the epilimnia. Annual whole-reservoir denitrification rates ranged from 12 to 23 g N m-2 yr-1. The hypolimnion contribution to annual denitrification was 16-25{\%}. Sediments in contact with epilimnia were the greatest N2 source in all of the reservoirs. However, denitrification in the anoxic metalimnion was of similar magnitude to denitrification in epilimnetic sediments at one reservoir, and variability in metalimnetic denitrification rates was related to the strength of stratification stability. Integrating habitat-specific measurements into whole-lake denitrification rates showed that hydrologically dynamic habitats represent important denitrification hotspots, and that periodic disturbances fuel hot moments for denitrification. {\textcopyright} 2012, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellate proliferation is common in coastal waters, and trophic strategies are often advanced to explain the success of these organisms. The Biguglia lagoon is a Mediterranean brackish ecosystem where eutrophication has long been an issue, and where dominance of dinoflagellates has persisted for several years. Monthly monitoring of fluorescence-based properties of phytoplankton communities carried out in 2010 suggested that photosynthesis alone could not support the observed situation all year round. Contrasting food webs developed depending on the hydrological season, with a gradual shift from autotrophy to heterotrophy. Progressively, microphytoplankton assemblages became unequivocally dominated by a Prorocentrum minimum bloom, which exhibited very weak effective photosynthetic performance, whereas paradoxically its theoretical capacities remained fully operational. Different environmental hypotheses explaining this discrepancy were examined, but rejected. We conclude that P. minimum bloom persistence is sustained by mixotrophic strategies, with complex compromises between phototrophy and phagotrophy, as evidenced by fluorescence-based observations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the time dynamics of phytoplankton size-biomass spectra over a 60 week period in a hypertrophic lake (El Porcal, near Madrid, Spain). Average total phytoplankton biomass was 59.5 mg l-1, and 58 taxa were present which had between 1.8 and 38.5 mum equivalent spherical diameter (ESD). Average biomass of pico-, nano- and microplankton was 0.04, 23 and 36.2 mg l-1, respectively. The average size-biomass spectrum was characterized by a higher amount of biomass in larger cells (biomass increase as the 0.59 power of body volume). The multivariate analysis generated five conspicuous groups of normalized biomass spectra which led to understanding of global dynamics as a time sequence of size structures in the studied lake. During a long equilibrium period, normalized biomass spectra change towards less negative slopes, i.e. an increase of larger cells. During the periods with a higher frequency of perturbations, the spectra evolve towards more negative slopes (increase of smaller cells). A comparison of this study with data from other aquatic systems suggests that the size-biomass spectrum is related to trophic state. In El Porcal Lake, size-spectrum descriptions are an adequate tool in the dynamic study of the phytoplankton community},

abstract = {The oxygen-consuming processes in the hypolimnia of freshwater lakes leading to deep-water anoxia are still not well understood, thereby constraining suitable management concepts. This study presents data obtained from 11 eutrophic lakes and suggests a model describing the consumption of dissolved oxygen (O 2) in the hypolimnia of eutrophic lakes as a result of only two fundamental processes: O 2 is consumed (i) by settled organic material at the sediment surface and (ii) by reduced substances diffusing from the sediment. Apart from a lake's productivity, its benthic O 2 consumption depends on the O 2 concentration in the water overlying the sediment and the molecular O 2 diffusion to the sediment. On the basis of observational evidence of long-term monitoring data from 11 eutrophic lakes, we found that the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate ranging from 0.47 to 1.31 g of O 2 m −2 d −1 (average 0.90 ± 0.30) is a function of (i) a benthic flux of reduced substances (0.37 ± 0.12 g of O 2 m −2 d −1) and (ii) an O 2 consumption which linearly increases with the mean hypolimnion thickness (z H) up to ∼25 m. This model has important implications for predicting and interpreting the response of lakes and reservoirs to restoration measures.},

abstract = {1. Picophytoplankton are planktonic photosynthetic O-2-evolvers that$\backslash$ncan pass through 2 mu m-diameter pores; they include prokaryotic$\backslash$n(eubacterial) and eukaryotic members and occur in freshwater and$\backslash$nmarine habitats. There are no photosynthetic reproductive and dispersal$\backslash$nstages of benthic macrophytes of picoplanktonic size. The picophytoplankton$\backslash$ncondition appears to be derived and polyphyletic in both prokaryotes$\backslash$nand eukaryotes. 2. Picophytoplankton are among the smallest free-living$\backslash$ncells, despite having to contain the photosynthetic apparatus, which$\backslash$noccupies about half of the cell volume, as well as core cellular$\backslash$nmachinery. The size of the smallest prokaryotic (0.6 mu m diameter)$\backslash$nand eukaryotic (0.95 mu m diameter) picophytoplankton are close to$\backslash$nthe minimum possible size estimated from the occurrence of non-scalable$\backslash$nessential components such as the genome and plasmalemma and other$\backslash$nmembranes. 3. Picophytoplankton cells have advantages relative to$\backslash$nlarger phytoplankton cells in terms of resource acquisition and the$\backslash$nsubsequent use of the resources in catalysing cell growth and reproduction.$\backslash$nThe smaller package effect in light harvesting means smaller resource$\backslash$n(energy, C, N, Fe, Mn, Cu) costs of photon harvesting and transformation$\backslash$ninto chemical energy in small than in large cells. The smaller diffusion$\backslash$nboundary layer around small cells, coupled with smaller nutrient$\backslash$nfluxes per unit plasmalemma area needed to attain a given fraction$\backslash$nof the maximum specific growth rate in smaller cells, increases the$\backslash$navailability of low concentrations of nutrients to small relative$\backslash$nto larger cells. If the supply of CO, to the core photosynthetic$\backslash$ncarboxylase ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase is purely$\backslash$nby diffusion then smaller cells could satisfy their catalytic requirements$\backslash$nwith less of this enzyme whose synthesis has high energy, C and N$\backslash$ncosts. Overall, resources can be acquired, and used in growth, more$\backslash$neffectively in smaller than in larger cells. 4. Some factors work$\backslash$nagainst the conclusion in (3.) but, in most habitats, do not negate$\backslash$nthese conclusions. Examples related to non-scalable essential cell$\backslash$ncomponents are the use of energy, C, N and P in the genome and of$\backslash$nenergy, C, N, P and Fe in the plasma membrane. Transport-related$\backslash$nfactors include the increased potential cell volume-specific leakage$\backslash$nof accumulated resources, and the greater cell volume-specific energy$\backslash$ncosts of motility at a given speed, in smaller than in larger cells.$\backslash$nThe smaller package effect in smaller cells involves a greater potential$\backslash$nfor photodamage by both photosynthetically active radiation and by$\backslash$nUV-B. 5. Picophytoplankton occurrence is also a function of factors$\backslash$nwhich lead to cell loss. Factors such as sinking out of the euphotic$\backslash$nzone and parasitism by eukaryotes such as chytrids are less significant$\backslash$nfor picophytoplankton than for larger cells, whereas viral parasitism$\backslash$nand grazing by appropriately sized grazers are likely to be at least$\backslash$nas great for picophytoplankton as for larger cells. 6. The totality$\backslash$nof the effects mentioned in (3.) above suggests that picophytoplankton$\backslash$nshould generally have higher specific growth rates (probably) in$\backslash$nresource-saturated (photons, C, N, P, Fe, etc.) and (certainly) in$\backslash$nresource-limited environments than do larger cells. The distribution$\backslash$nof picophytoplankton is certainly consistent with their ability to$\backslash$ncapitalize on resource-limited environments: they contribute a larger$\backslash$nfraction of biomass and productivity relative to larger cells in$\backslash$nlow-nutrient than in high-nutrient environments, and in low-light$\backslash$n(e.g. the deep chlorophyll maximum) than in high-light environments.$\backslash$n7. Sexual reproduction is apparently rare in picophytoplankton, with$\backslash$nimplications for species definition. There are probably relatively$\backslash$nfew species (hundreds or thousands) with very wide biogeographical$\backslash$nranges in marine or in freshwater habitats. The small size and (probably)$\backslash$nlow biodiversity means large numbers of individuals worldwide, e.g.$\backslash$nc.10(26) individuals of the commonest species of the marine cyanobacterium$\backslash$nSynechococcus. Picophytoplankton contribute at least one-tenth (i.e.$\backslash$nin excess of 3 Pg C per year) to global aquatic net primary productivity.$\backslash$n},

Simultaneous measurements of individual particle cell size, fluorescence, and light scatter properties are directly applicable to current topics in aquatic research. Flow sorting may be employed to obtain subsets of cells for analysis by conventional methods. The manner in which rapid, precise measurements of single cells are made is complex, and the application of this technology to aquatic samples is subject to many analytical constraints. Flow cytometric measurements of algal cell size and pigment autofluorescence are relative and are therefore dependent on the optical configuration and variability of the instrument. Specific types of reference materials are used to establish the validity of analyses: 1) instrument standards, 2) fluorescence controls, and 3) internal stain standards. The selection and application of standards and controls are discussed in the context of allometric (cell size versus pigment fluorescence) and ataxonomic (pigment color groups) methods. The widespread acceptance of particular reference materials among research groups will result in comparable data sets describing aquatic particle distributions.},

abstract = {Temporal scales of variability for the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the surface waters of two stratified Mediterranean reservoirs were examined through the temporal decomposition of 5month time series with hourly sampling frequency. pCO2 time series included similar patterns of variability at daily, biweekly, and seasonal scales regardless of the difference in amplitude of the pCO2 variation in the two reservoirs studied. Daily variability was strongly related to the day-night cycles of metabolic activity, accounting for about one third of the total amplitude in pCO2 variation. At a biweekly scale, wind forcing led to higher rates of air-water CO2 exchange and subsequently temporary partial mixing events associated to relevant increase of CO 2 concentration in surface waters. Seasonal variability accounted for one third of the amplitude of the pCO2 variability and was coupled to the seasonal dynamics of water temperature and thermal stratification of the water column. Our results provide evidence that CO2 emission from stratified water bodies shows significant variability at daily, biweekly, and seasonal scales; all of which should be taken into consideration in the analyses of the carbon fluxes. The wind-induced mixing events, operating at temporal scales between daily and seasonal cycles, may become a major factor controlling the pCO2 dynamics. Hence, some of the most common models for computing CO2 fluxes from pCO2 were not able to reproduce the biweekly response patterns of CO2 emissions to wind forcing. {\textcopyright}2014.

Data analysis performed on microscope identified and quantified species did not show a significant temperature influence on phytoplankton community composition. However, the HPLC data indicated that temperature changes of as little as 3 ??C influence the community composition. In particular, these data showed that peridinin-containing dinoflagellates only increased in abundance in the heated mesocosms and that a prasinophycean bloom, which was undetected in the microscope analyses, occurred prior to the blooms of all other phytoplankton classes in all treatments. The microscope analyses did reveal a temperature effect on individual species distribution patterns. Thalassionema nitzschioides was more abundant in the warm treatments and, in the warmest treatment, the spring bloom forming Skeletonema marinoi comprised a smaller proportion of the diatom community than in the other treatments. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Cells were grown in oxygen-sulfide counter-gradients within tubes filled with agar-solidified medium. The immobilized cells grew mainly in the anoxic zone, revealing a peak below the oxic-anoxic interface. All tested strains survived exposure to air for 8 h and all were capable of oxygen reduction with lactate. Most strains also oxidized sulfide with oxygen. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans responded chemotactically to lactate, nitrate, sulfate and thiosulfate, and even sulfide functioned as an attractant. In oxic-anoxic gradients the bacteria moved away from high oxygen concentrations and formed bands at the outer edge of the oxic zone at low oxygen concentration ({\textless}5{\%} O2 saturation). They were able to actively change the extension and slope of the gradients by oxygen reduction with lactate or even sulfide as electron donor. Generally, the chemotactic behavior was in agreement with a defense strategy that re-establishes anoxic conditions, thus promoting anaerobic growth and, in a natural community, fermentative production of the preferred electron donors of the sulfate-reducing bacteria.},

However, relatively few studies address the balance between the atmospheric carbon flux and sedimentation in these ecosystems. We performed a simultaneous analysis of the sedimentation fluxes of particulate organic carbon (SPOC) and atmospheric CO2 fluxes ((Formula presented.)) in the epilimnetic zone of two monomictic Mediterranean reservoirs. CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) was monitored hourly, and SPOC was measured at biweekly intervals with sediment traps during the stratification period. Both reservoirs were zones of intense organic carbon sedimentation and CO2 emission to the atmosphere despite having different trophic statuses. The positive relationship observed between SPOC and (Formula presented.) was likely due to the inputs of organic matter and nutrients to the epilimnion, which increased both sedimentation and CO2 emission. Nonetheless, the stronger effect on the sedimentation process led to a net downward flux of carbon in spite of the heterotrophic nature of both reservoirs.},

abstract = {The size–abundance spectrum (SAS) of phytoplankton is controlled by the interplay of physical and biological factors whose particular relevance varies between ecosystems. Here we report the results of a study of phytoplankton SAS in a system of eight estuarine shallow, eutrophic lagoons (Guadalhorce river, South Spain). SAS were obtained through a combination of flow cytometry and image analysis microscopy techniques covering six orders of magnitude from picoplankton to microplankton. Cell numbers were classified into a log2 scale of cell volume to model the log–log relation between cell abundance (cells/mL) and cell volume ($\mu$m3). The resulting averaged phytoplankton SAS can be described by a log–log transformed, power model with a slope of – 0.62 (that is, there is an allometric relation between the size and abundance of cells). The distribution of biovolume ($\mu$m3/l) in broader size categories is characterized by the dominance of nanoplankton (67.4{\%}), followed by microplankton (30.1{\%}) and picoplankton (2.5{\%}). The minor relative contribution of picoplankton to total biovolume can be explained by a combination of high and variable rates of nutrient inputs, light stress and grazing. The biomass dominance of intermediate-size cells (nanoplankton) is coherent with experimental findings describing the unimodal size scaling of growth rate, with maximum values centered in this size category.},

abstract = {Methane (CH4) represents a major product of organic matter decomposition in lakes. Once produced in the sediments, CH4 can be either oxidized or emitted as a greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. Lakes represent an important source of atmospheric CH4, but the relative magnitudes of the internal pathways that lead to CH4 emissions are not yet clear. We quantified internal cycling and methane emissions in three lakes during summer stratification. These methane budgets included: sediment release of CH4 at different depths; water column transport patterns and methane oxidation; methane storage in the water column; and methane emissions to the atmosphere by diffusion and ebullition. The contribution of CH4 carbon, via oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria, to pelagic food webs was also estimated. Despite the very low concentration of CH4 in surface waters, shallow, epilimnetic sediments were major contributors of CH4 to the atmosphere. While 51-80{\%} of the CH4 produced in deep sediments was oxidized in the water column, most of the CH4 released from shallow sediment escaped oxidation and reached the atmosphere. Epilimnetic sediments accounted for 100{\%} of CH4 emitted during summer stratification, and 14-76{\%} considering the release of CH4 stored in deep water layers during lake circulation after the stratification period; diffusive emission accounted for 26-48{\%} and ebullition the remainder. These results indicate that it is important to address transport rates of CH4 from the shallow sediment along with the production-consumption processes when trying to understand methane dynamics and the regulation of lake methane emissions.

We show that climate change–induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase (19 ± 14{\%}) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the “business-as-usual” scenario. The impacts, driven by projected increases in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn belt of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 ± 24{\%} reduction in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive management challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future changes in precipitation on nitrogen loading.},

abstract = {Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) by methanotrophic archaea is an important sink of this greenhouse gas in marine sediments. However, evidence for AOM in freshwater habitats is rare, and little is known about the pathways, electron acceptors, and microbes involved. Here, we show that AOM occurs in anoxic sediments of a sulfate-rich lake in southern Switzerland (Lake Cadagno). Combined AOM-rate and 16S rRNA gene-sequencing data suggest that Candidatus Methanoperedens archaea are responsible for the observed methane oxidation. Members of the Methanoperedenaceae family were previously reported to conduct nitrate- or iron/manganese-dependent AOM. However, we demonstrate for the first time that the methanotrophic archaea do not necessarily rely upon these oxidants as terminal electron acceptors directly, but mainly perform canonical sulfate-dependent AOM, which under sulfate-starved conditions can be supported by metal (Mn, Fe) oxides through oxidation of reduced sulfur species to sulfate. The correspondence of high abundances of Desulfobulbaceae and Candidatus Methanoperedens at the same sediment depth confirms the interdependence of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The relatively high abundance and widespread distribution of Candidatus Methanoperedens in lake sediments highlight their potentially important role in mitigating methane emissions from terrestrial freshwater environments to the atmosphere, analogous to ANME-1, -2, and -3 in marine settings.},

abstract = {We explore the role of lakes in carbon cycling and global climate, examine the mechanisms influencing carbon pools and transformations in lakes, and discuss how the metabolism of carbon in the inland waters is likely to change in response to climate. Furthermore, we project changes as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of lakes in the biosphere, and we revise the estimate for the global extent of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may be changed by human activities, including construction of impoundments, which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle, (2) their contribution to this cycle has significantly changed as a result of human activities, and (3) they will continue to change in response to future climate change causing decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases in the number of aquatic impoundments.},

In the period of the present study, DOC values ranged from 42 to 198$\mu$M, while DON ranged from 0 to 20$\mu$M. The seasonal variations showed high mean surface concentrations of DOC (106.2±25.6$\mu$M-C) and DON (8.6±3.1$\mu$M-N) in May, shifting to low DOC (89.1±26.4$\mu$M-C) and DON (4.2±2.8$\mu$M-N) in February. In spring, DOC and DON released by phytoplankton are likely to be the most significant source of organic matter. Low DOC and DON concentrations during winter are probably due to the uptake of DOC and DON by bacteria and to the strong mixing of the water column. The spatial variations showed the highest mean concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the lower part of the Guadalquivir Estuary and the lowest mean concentrations of DOM in the bottom water of the oceanic zone. The very high mean DOC and DON concentrations measured off the Guadalquivir Estuary may be due to river input and/or re-suspension of the organic matter from the bottom sediments. The very low mean DOC and DON concentrations measured in the bottom water of the continental shelf may be due to mineralization and a surplus of more refractory organic carbon.},

abstract = {Extreme weather events can pervasively influence ecosystems. Observations in lakes indicate that severe storms in particular can have pronounced ecosystem-scale consequences, but the underlying mechanisms have not been rigorously assessed in experiments. One major effect of storms on lakes is the redistribution of mineral resources and plankton communities as a result of abrupt thermocline deepening. We aimed at elucidating the importance of this effect by mimicking in replicated large enclosures (each 9 m in diameter, ca. 20 m deep, ca. 1300 m3 in volume) a mixing event caused by a severe natural storm that was previously observed in a deep clear-water lake. Metabolic rates were derived from diel changes in vertical profiles of dissolved oxygen concentrations using a Bayesian modelling approach, based on high-frequency measurements. Experimental thermocline deepening stimulated daily gross primary production (GPP) in surface waters by an average of 63{\%} for {\textgreater}4 weeks even though thermal stratification re-established within 5 days. Ecosystem respiration (ER) was tightly coupled to GPP, exceeding that in control enclosures by 53{\%} over the same period. As GPP responded more strongly than ER, net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of the entire water column was also increased. These protracted increases in ecosystem metabolism and autotrophy were driven by a proliferation of inedible filamentous cyanobacteria released from light and nutrient limitation after they were entrained from below the thermocline into the surface water. Thus, thermocline deepening by a single severe storm can induce prolonged responses of lake ecosystem metabolism independent of other storm-induced effects, such as inputs of terrestrial materials by increased catchment run-off. This highlights that future shifts in frequency, severity or timing of storms are an important component of climate change, whose impacts on lake thermal structure will superimpose upon climate trends to influence algal dynamics and organic matter cycling in clear-water lakes.},

We show that such an approach, augmented by a mechanistic analysis of trade-offs among functional traits, can be successfully used to explain community composition of marine phytoplankton along environmental gradients. Our analysis of literature on major functional traits in phytoplankton, such as parameters of nutrient-dependent growth and uptake, reveals physiological trade-offs in species abilities to acquire and utilize resources. These trade-offs, arising from fundamental relations such as cellular scaling laws and enzyme kinetics, define contrasting ecological strategies of nutrient acquisition. Major groups of marine eukaryotic phytoplankton have adopted distinct strategies with associated traits. These diverse strategies of nutrient utilization can explain the distribution patterns of major functional groups and size classes along nutrient availability gradients.},

As a result of global change, aquatic ecosystems are under strong environmental stress due to changes in water flow or nutrient concentration among others. This chapter presents a review of experimental and field studies addressing metal effects on fluvial biofilms and their implications for understanding the potential influence of water scarcity on the fate and effects of metals in fluvial systems. Water scarcity might increase metal exposure (due to low dilution), uptake (due to higher retention under low flow), toxicity and/or accumu- lation (depending on the dose and time of exposure) but may also cause opposite effects depending on the source of pollution. In addition, the influence that water scarcity might have on nutrient loads will also modulate the fate and effects of metals. Future studies addressing the role of environmental stress on the effects of toxicants at a community scale will be fundamental to predict the impact of toxicants in the aquatic ecosystems.

abstract = {Global change is modifying meteorological and hydrological factors that influence the thermal regime of water bodies. These modifications can lead to longer stratification periods with enlarged hypolimnetic anoxic periods, which can promote heterotrophic anaerobic processes and alter reservoir carbon cycling. Here, we quantified aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophic processes (aerobic respiration, denitrification, iron and manganese reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis) on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production in the hypolimnion of a Mediterranean reservoir (El Gergal, Spain) under two contrasting hydrological conditions: a wet year with heavy direct rainfall and frequent water inputs from upstream reservoirs, and a dry year with scarce rainfall and negligible water inputs. During the wet year, water inputs and rainfall induced low water column thermal stability and earlier turnover. By contrast, thermal stratification was longer and more stable during the dry year. During wet conditions, we observed lower DIC accumulation in the hypolimnion, mainly due to weaker sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. By contrast, longer stratification during the dry year promoted higher hypolimnetic DIC accumulation, resulting from enhanced methanogenesis and sulfate reduction, thus increasing methane emissions and impairing reservoir water quality. Aerobic respiration, denitrification and metal reduction produced a similar amount of DIC in the hypolimnion during the two studied years. All in all, biological and geochemical (calcite dissolution) processes explained most of hypolimnetic DIC accumulation during stratification regardless of the hydrological conditions, but there is still {\~{}} 30{\%} of hypolimnetic DIC production that cannot be explained by the processes contemplated in this study and the assumptions made.},

abstract = {Reservoir drawdown areas—where sediment is exposed to the atmosphere due to water-level fluctuations—are hotspots for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, the global extent of drawdown areas is unknown, precluding an accurate assessment of the carbon budget of reservoirs. Here we show, on the basis of satellite observations of 6,794 reservoirs between 1985 and 2015, that 15{\%} of the global reservoir area was dry. Exposure of drawdown areas was most pronounced in reservoirs close to the tropics and shows a complex dependence on climatic (precipitation, temperature) and anthropogenic (water use) drivers. We re-assessed the global carbon emissions from reservoirs by apportioning CO2 and methane emissions to water surfaces and drawdown areas using published areal emission rates. The new estimate assigns 26.2 (15–40) (95{\%} confidence interval) TgCO2-C yr−1 to drawdown areas, and increases current global CO2 emissions from reservoirs by 53{\%} (60.3 (43.2–79.5) TgCO2-C yr−1). Taking into account drawdown areas, the ratio between carbon emissions and carbon burial in sediments is 2.02 (1.04–4.26). This suggests that reservoirs emit more carbon than they bury, challenging the current understanding that reservoirs are net carbon sinks. Thus, consideration of drawdown areas overturns our conception of the role of reservoirs in the carbon cycle. Globally, reservoirs are net emitters of carbon when drawdown areas are taken into account, according to an analysis of satellite observations of reservoir surface area.},

abstract = {Organic matter decomposition and ecosystem metabolism have been suggested as promising functional indicators of stream ecosystem integrity, but tests of their applicability to tropical systems are rare. Here, we tested the suitability of the ecosystem processes leaf decomposition (LD), community respiration (CR) and gross primary production (GPP) as functional indicators of catchment and riparian corridor land use impacts on 16 rural, tropical headwater streams. Agricultural and urban land cover contributed 0.0-78.3{\%} and 0.0-8.3{\%}, respectively, to total catchment land cover, and 0.0-61.2{\%} and 0.0-7.8{\%}, respectively, to land cover in a riparian corridor of 20 m width of the investigated streams. Median rates of GPP and CR in the studied streams were 0.4 g O2 m-2 d-1 (0.0-1.6, min-max) and 3.3 g O2 m-2 d-1 (1.8-15), respectively. According to the double exponential model, median leaf litter decay coefficients of the recalcitrant and the labile litter fraction were 0.006 d-1 (-0.017 to 0.016) and 0.15 d-1 (0.06-0.86), respectively. While land use in the riparian corridor was correlated to the studied ecosystem processes, whole catchment land use did not exhibit such relations. Nitrogen enrichment and increased CR, both related to urban land use, were the main impacts, indicating that already low levels of urban land cover can have considerable effects on stream integrity in the investigated rural tropical landscape. Although spanning a much wider gradient, agricultural land cover was a less important stressor, and stimulated GPP was related to stream morphology, but not to nutrient enrichment. Leaf decomposition was negatively correlated with both the agricultural and the urban impacts, suggesting that high rates of leaf decomposition are an indicator of pristine conditions in the studied streams. In conclusion, measurements of LD, CR and GPP appear to be suitable, and complementary functional indicators of stream integrity and provided insights into mechanisms of land use impacts on streams in tropical rural catchments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The yield of chlorophyll from dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) has been shown to be a potentially useful parameter for predicting eutrophication, particularly, in the northerly, coastal waters of the North East Atlantic (NEA). This study investigates whether this parameter might also be appropriate for the southerly, coastal waters of the NEA. Nitrogen enrichment experiments were carried out using microcosms to determine the microplanktonic yield of chlorophyll from DIN in waters from the Ria Formosa (April 2002) and from Sagres (September 2002) on the south coast of Portugal. Continuous culture techniques enabled experiments to be run for 7 days after enrichment so that changes in the cumulative yield over time could be calculated. Yields from the Sagres experiment were consistently higher than those from the Ria Formosa experiment, with respective maximum yields of 4.7 and 2.1 mug chl (mumol N)(-1), and respective steady-state yields of 3.1 and 0.9 mug chl (mumol N)(-1). In addition, regressions carried out on historical data sets from the two study sites showed poor correlation between chlorophyll and nitrate. Other differences between the microcosm experiments at the two sites, included: background concentrations of DIN, silicate and phosphate that were, respectively, 5.6 muM 8.1 muM, and 0.3 muM higher in the Ria; chlorophyll concentrations at Sagres that were double those of the Ria; accumulation of particulate nitrogen that was both more rapid and more substantial at Sagres; a different community structure for the diatoms at the two sites; more numerous autotrophic dinoflagellates, flagellates and cyanobacteria, as well as more numerous protozoan grazers, at Sagres. These differences may explain why the yield of chlorophyll from DIN at Sagres is one of the highest reported in the literature. This yield parameter requires further study under a range of seasonal conditions and with a range of microplankton communities before it could be considered useful for predicting eutrophication throughout the coastal waters of the NEA},

abstract = {To ascertain the general patterns in phytoplankton size structure of a temperate, coastal ecosystem, we determined the scaling relationship between total abundance and cell size (size spectrum) for nano- and micro-phytoplankton in a shelf station off NW Iberian Peninsula on a monthly basis during the period 1993-2002. The inverse linear relationship between log abundance and log cell size was persistent throughout the water column and across seasonal and inter-annual time scales. In addition, and despite the high productivity and marked temporal variability in water column structure at our study site, departures from linearity in the size spectra were rare. The slope (-0.96) of the overall size spectrum for the entire time series indicated that roughly equal amounts of biomass were present over different logarithmic size classes in the size range considered. The phytoplankton size spectra had similar average slopes during winter mixing, early upwelling, summer stratification and autumn downwelling, suggesting that, under these oceanographic conditions, both nano- and micro-phytoplankton respond similarly to environmental variability. In contrast, significantly less negative slopes were observed during upwelling relaxation, indicating an increased importance of larger cells. Our results illustrate the utility of individual size distributions to provide a synthetic description of phytoplankton community structure in dynamic, non steady-state marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments on resuspension of benthic diatoms were performed in 1988 on intact cores of sediment obtained from two transects in the Ems estuary (Dutch Wadden Sea, NW Europe). Diatoms were most abundant in sediment from sheltered stations. In the experiments, which were performed in a small carousel system, the percentage of resuspended diatoms increased concomitantly with angular velocity of the agitating paddles. Maximum microphytobenthos resuspension in terms of cell numbers was up to 45{\%} of the total population present in the 0.5-cm top layer, and up to 11{\%} in terms of chlorophylla. Maximum sediment resuspension was 6{\%}. The results show that the presence of a diatom film (numerous cells on the sediment surface) increases sediment stability, thereby suppressing resuspension of sediment and diatoms. However, if the sediment contains many fine particles and much detritus, sediment stability decreases, leading to increased resuspension. These results support the contention that low detritus content and large numbers stabilize the surface layer of tidal flats, whereas high detritus content and fewer cells ({\textless}2 ×=""{\textgreater}5 cm–2) do not. The stabilization is thought to be dependent on a combination of differences in sediment consolidation and in bottom roughness caused by the presence or absence of diatom films},

Therefore the hypolimnetic oxygen deficit can be modeled as a zero‐order chemical process that is independent of oxygen concentration. Predictions of seasonal changes in hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations can be made by estimating the slope of the linear regression of oxygen concentration against the Julian day when the sample was collected.

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) transfer from inland waters to the atmosphere, known as CO2 evasion, is a component of the global carbon cycle. Global estimates of CO2 evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32Pg Cyr-1 from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg Cyr-1 is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

By measuring oxygen penetration depths, rates of oxygen uptake, the release of manganese and iron as well as denitrification and sulfate reduction, it could be shown that sulfate reduction was the dominant respiration process in sediments sampled in summer, autumn, and winter. The ratio of the relative percentage of anaerobic to aerobic organic carbon oxidation varied between 3:1 and 15:1. In spring 1997, however, oxygen respiration was dominant. Carbon oxidation by manganese, nitrate and iron was insignificant at all times. A total benthic respiration of 0.8 to 2.3 mmol C m−2 h−1 was estimated. Between 20 and 89{\%} of the total gross pelagic and benthic primary production was respired by heterotrophic organisms.},

abstract = {The generic geochemical effects of adding CO 2 to water, to water and solids (with carbonate minerals) and to water and solids with exchangeable surface sites has been calculated and reviewed below. Although the reaction details are clearly a function of the fluid composition, the partial pressure of the CO 2 being added, the mineralogy and the cation exchange capacity, some generic conclusions can be reacted. The atmosphere controls the final dissolved CO 2 levels and brings them back to very near original values-effectively, there is little or no carbon storage in the fluid. There is no carbon storage by precipitation of carbonate minerals in "short term processes-this process is driven by the dissolution of silicate minerals which react much more slowly. If carbonate minerals were present in the original mineralogy, some portion will dissolve (when CO 2 is added). This may result in additional CO 2 being released to the atmosphere. Fundamental Geochemical Processes The solubility of carbon dioxide in pure water is a function of pressure and temperature, as shown in Figure 1. To summarize, increasing CO 2 pressure increases the solubility of CO 2 in the fluid. Increasing temperature decreases the solubility of CO 2 in the fluid unless the pressure and temperature is approximately above 30 MPa and 65 o C respectively, where solubility begins to increase.},

abstract = {Eutrophication increases hypoxia in lakes and reservoirs, causing deleterious effects on biological communities. Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: One in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

abstract = {Methane is a potent greenhouse gas whose emission from sediments in inland waters and shallow oceans may both contribute to global warming and be exacerbated by it. The fraction of methane emitted by sediments that bypasses dissolution in the water column and reaches the atmosphere as bubbles depends on the mode and spatiotemporal characteristics of venting from the sediments. Earlier studies have concluded that hot spots - persistent, high-flux vents - dominate the regional ebullitive flux from submerged sediments. Here the spatial structure, persistence, and variability in the intensity of methane venting are analyzed using a high-resolution multibeam sonar record acquired at the bottom of a lake during multiple deployments over a 9 month period. We confirm that ebullition is strongly episodic, with distinct regimes of high flux and low flux largely controlled by changes in hydrostatic pressure. Our analysis shows that the spatial pattern of ebullition becomes homogeneous at the sonar's resolution over time scales of hours (for high-flux periods) or days (for low-flux periods), demonstrating that vents are ephemeral rather than persistent, and suggesting that long-term, lake-wide ebullition dynamics may be modeled without resolving the fine-scale spatial structure of venting.},

abstract = {The distribution of phytoplankton abundance and species composition is described for coastal waters of the NW Adriatic Sea, for the period 1990-1999. Hydrochemical and biological properties were investigated every month, at 48 stations. This coastal system is quite unstable and heterogeneous, due to the influence of several rivers, intense water exchange with the Lagoon of Venice, and complex advective processes. In the vicinity of river plumes, dissolved nitrogen and dissolved silica appear to be in excess, rarely limiting phytoplankton growth. Examining the general trend of phytoplankton over the years, the main limiting factors for phytoplankton growth in the Adriatic coastal system are light, temperature, and the strong influence of meteorological events. The NW Adriatic coastal area was subdivided into three zones, each characterised by different trophic conditions. In each zone, phytoplankton was similar in terms of community structure and was different only in abundance. Three main periods of growth were observed: February, April and July. As expected in a nutrient-enriched system, the community structure was dominated by diatoms (both micro- and nanoplankton fractions), over most of the year. The importance of dinoflagellates in the communities was generally low, with significant abundances present only in June-July, once the spring bloom of diatoms had left 'nutrient-poor' conditions in the water. These low concentrations of nutrients favoured the growth of dinoflagellates, which have lower nutritional requirements. Over the 10-year study, a decrease in orthophosphate concentrations was observed. This pattern could be explained as a consequence of reduced quantities of phosphorus used in detergents, in the late 1980s. No significant change in any hydrochemical or biological property was observed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Study region: Tarago Reservoir, Victoria, Australia. Study focus: This study investigates the influence of rainfall, river inflow and wind on the temperature stratification of the Tarago Reservoir by incorporating atmospheric and bathymetric conditions using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. New hydrological insights for this region: In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model was developed and applied to the Tarago Reservoir. The model allowed 3D visualization of the thermal structure, and the seasonal and longitudinal differences in stratification could be quantified using the Schmidt stability index. The simulation results revealed longitudinal differences in thermal structure among the riverine, transition, and lacustrine zones. The bathymetry affects the lake stratification and stability; furthermore, the strong vertical current caused by the sharp bathymetry gradient significantly weakens the stability in deep zones. In addition, this study assessed the impacts of rainfall and wind on lake stability using sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that rainfall decreases the water temperature of the lake but hardly affects the summer stratification. Moreover, the wind not only influences the intensity and duration of stratification but also contributes to the heat storage of waterbodies. The patterns of water current velocities and temperature also showed that the circulation generated by overflow and underflow plumes have a crucial effect on the thermal structure of the transition and lacustrine zones.},

It can be estimated by associating the algae with similar geometric forms and determining the volume of these by measuring the linear dimensions required for its calculation under the microscope. However, the lack of a standardized set of geometric forms and equations for calculating biovolume causes difficulties and produces data that are not comparable. 4 - A set of geometric models is suggested here for calculating the cell biovolumes of 201 phytoplankton genera found in transitional water ecosystems of Mediterranean Ecoregion.

abstract = {Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a major biological process that reduces global methane emission to the atmosphere. Anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) mediate this process through the coupling of methane oxidation to different electron acceptors, or in concert with a syntrophic bacterial partner. Recently, ANME belonging to the archaeal family Methanoperedenaceae (formerly known as ANME-2d) were shown to be capable of AOM coupled to nitrate and iron reduction. Here, a freshwater sediment bioreactor fed with methane and Mn(IV) oxides (birnessite) resulted in a microbial community dominated by two novel members of the Methanoperedenaceae, with biochemical profiling of the system demonstrating Mn(IV)-dependent AOM. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed the expression of key genes involved in methane oxidation and several shared multiheme c-type cytochromes (MHCs) that were differentially expressed, indicating the likely use of different extracellular electron transfer pathways. We propose the names “Candidatus Methanoperedens manganicus” and “Candidatus Methanoperedens manganireducens” for the two newly described Methanoperedenaceae species. This study demonstrates the ability of members of the Methanoperedenaceae to couple AOM to the reduction of Mn(IV) oxides, which suggests their potential role in linking methane and manganese cycling in the environment.},

abstract = {Two diel field campaigns under different weather patterns were carried out in the summer and autumn of 2013 to measure CO2 and CH4 fluxes and to probe the rates of gas exchange across the air-water interface in a subtropical eutrophic pond in China. Bubble emissions of CH4 accounted for 99.7 and 91.67{\%} of the total CH4 emission measured at two sites in the summer; however, no bubblewas observed in the autumn.The pondwas supersaturated with CO2 and CH4 during themonitoring period, and the saturation ratios (i.e. observed concentration/equilibrium concentration) of CH4 were much higher than that of CO2. Although the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the surface water collected in the autumn was 1.24 times of that in the summer, the mean diffusive CO2 flux across the water-air interface measured in the summer is almost twice compared with that in the autumn. The mean concentration of dissolved CH4 in the surface water in the autumn was around half of that in the summer, but the mean diffusive CH4 flux in the summer is 4-5 times of that in the autumn. Our data showed that the variation in gas exchange rate was dominated by differences in weather patterns and primary production. Averaged k600-CO2 and k600-CH4 (the gas transfer velocity normalised to a Schmidt number of 600)were 0.65 and 0.55 cm/h in the autumn, and 2.83 and 1.64cm/h in the summer, respectively. No statistically significant correlation was found between k600 and U10 (wind speed at 10mheight) in the summer at lowwind speeds in clearweather.Diffusive gas fluxes increased during the nights, which resulted from the nighttime cooling effect of water surface and stronger turbulent mixing in the water column. The chemical enhancements for CO2 were estimated up to 1.94-fold in the hot and clear summer with low wind speeds, which might have been resulted from the increasing hydration reactions in water due to the high water temperature and active metabolism in planktonic algae. However, both the air and surface water temperatures decreased continually, and relatively lower temperature and overcast weather with occasionally light rain dominated the second campaign in the autumn. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the surfacewater and U10 controlled gas transfer velocities of CO2 and CH4, respectively, in the cool autumn. When the surface water temperaturewas higher than the air temperature, higher CO2 fluxwas observed because thewater bodywas unstable and overturned quickly, inducing quick CO2 emitted from plankton algae in surface water to the atmosphere.},

abstract = {This study examines the spatio-temporal variability of the turbidity plume and phytoplankton biomass (in terms of chlorophyll) in the marine region influenced by the Guadalquivir estuary using ocean colour images over a period of 11 years (2003-2013). The area of the turbidity plume was calculated using water-leaving radiance at 555 nm (nLw555). Climatologic and monthly averages showed recurrent high nLw555 levels in winter and high chlorophyll in spring. Similar variability was confirmed by Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of 8-day composite images, illustrating the existence of different regions with similar behavior. The first EOF mode explained 60.7{\%} and 31{\%} of the variability in nLw555 and chlorophyll, respectively, and was associated with enhanced Total Suspended Solids (TSS) in autumn-winter and phytoplankton blooms in winter-spring periods. The results confirmed that the development of the turbidity plume and subsequent phytoplankton blooms were strongly regulated by river discharges and precipitation. Indeed, interannual variation in nLw555 was consistent with changes in the large-scale climate index, the North Atlantic Oscillation, a proxy for regional rainfall patterns. In the case of phytoplankton biomass, the second EOF mode revealed differentiation between offshore and nearshore areas, the latter characterized by delayed development of phytoplankton bloom due to light limitation by high TSS. This suggests that the stability of the water column, via its influence on phytoplankton light-limitation, influenced also the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton bloom events. The dynamic of the Guadalquivir estuary turbidity plume is a crucial factor for the pelagic ecosystem of the Eastern Gulf of Cadiz, governing phytoplankton productivity.},

abstract = {Low dissolved oxygen concentration in bottom layers of lakes and reservoirs usually indicates low water quality. In lakes, empirical models predicting anoxia are almost entirely based on the decay of plankton biomass, while in reservoirs recent findings suggest a prominent role of streamflow and load of organic carbon. This suggests a potential link between water quality in reservoirs and climate processes affecting streamflow. Here we support this hypothesis presenting evidence that both interannual climate variability and recent climate change, mainly consisting in a significant increase in potential evapotranspiration in the upstream basin, affected the oxygen content in a Mediterranean reservoir (Sau Reservoir, Spain). Using a 44-year monthly record, we found strong and consistent signatures of El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation in the inflow and reservoir oxygen content. Spectral and wavelet techniques showed that the El Ni{\~{n}}o, streamflow, and reservoir oxygen content series oscillated in common periods, which coincided with the main El Ni{\~{n}}o variability modes. An empirical model explaining the annual oxygen content in the reservoir suggested that a decreasing streamflow trend reduced the oxygen content of the reservoir by about 20{\%}, counteracting remediation measures implemented at the basin upstream the reservoir. Our results provide the first quantitative evidence of climate change effects on reservoir water quality using long-term instrumental data, and indicate that streamflow should be considered as a key variable in assessing climate change impact on reservoir water quality. These results are especially relevant in regions of the world where reservoirs are abundant and most climate models predict a decrease in runoff during the next decades. Both the expected trends and the sensitivity of reservoir water quality to global interannual climate variability should be considered for a correct management of water resources in the present and to design adaptation policies in the future. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Summertime hypolimnetic anoxia can occur in productive drinking water reservoirs as a result of the decay of phytoplankton. Anoxic conditions promote ecological processes that degrade water quality through the release of problem-causing compounds from anoxic sediments including phosphates, ammonia, sulfides, methyl-mercury, iron and manganese. Hypolimnetic aeration systems are commonly installed in reservoirs to prevent hypolimnetic anoxia, but these systems have been historically undersized due to an underestimation of the magnitude of oxygen demand in the hypolimnion. To gain insight into the sizing of hypolimnetic aeration systems, this study evaluated the effects of water current and DO concentration near the sediment-water interface on sediment oxygen demand (SOD) in nine California drinking water reservoirs of various size (5–220 million m3) and trophic status (mean annual chlorophyll a of 0.5–11 $\mu$g L−1). SOD measured under quiescent conditions in 1.8 L experimental chambers ranged from 0.1–0.8 g m2 d1 Currents near the sediment-water interface of 3–8 cm s1 induced a two to four-fold increase in SOD, and resulted in a shift from first-order to zero-order DO uptake by sediment with respect to DO concentration in overlaying water. Results support the diffusive boundary layer model for SOD, with increased DO concentration and currents resulting in a larger SOD since there is a greater diffusional driving force across a smaller diffusive boundary layer. The study also evaluated the effects of trophic status and morphometry on hypolimnetic anoxia at the nine study sites. A number of significant correlations were discovered between factor quantifying hypolimnetic anoxia (areal and mass based hypolimnetic oxygen demand, SOD) and those quantifying morphometry (mean depth of the hypolimnion, volume of the hypolimnion) and trophic status (mean annual chlorophyll a). These results suggest that both increased size of the hypolimnion and higher productivity lead to higher oxygen demand within the hypolimnion. In addition, shallower reservoirs had a larger fraction of their total oxygen demand exerted in the sediments versus the water column. As a result, increased mixing at the sediment-water interface after start-up of aeration systems, and the resulting stimulation of SOD, will be particularly important in productive reservoirs of moderate depth (mean depth of 10–15 m). Aeration systems should be designed to enhance SOD by maintaining high oxygen concentrations and by inducing currents at the sediment-water interface. This will increase the depth of penetration of DO into sediment and promote beneficial aerobic biogeochemical reactions in surface sediments. Aeration systems that utilize pure-oxygen with horizontal discharge of highly oxygenated water across the sediment surface, rather than the traditional air-lift aeration system, will be more successful in satisfying SOD and improving hypolimnetic water quality. {\textcopyright} 2003 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As a high-throughput technology that offers rapid quantification of multidimensional characteristics for millions of cells, flow cytometry (FCM) is widely used in health research, medical diagnosis and treatment, and vaccine development. Nevertheless, there is an increasing concern about the lack of appropriate software tools to provide an automated analysis platform to parallelize the high-throughput data-generation platform. Currently, to a large extent, FCM data analysis relies on the manual selection of sequential regions in 2-D graphical projections to extract the cell populations of interest. This is a time-consuming task that ignores the high-dimensionality of FCM data. RESULTS: In view of the aforementioned issues, we have developed an R package called flowClust to automate FCM analysis. flowClust implements a robust model-based clustering approach based on multivariate t mixture models with the Box-Cox transformation. The package provides the functionality to identify cell populations whilst simultaneously handling the commonly encountered issues of outlier identification and data transformation. It offers various tools to summarize and visualize a wealth of features of the clustering results. In addition, to ensure its convenience of use, flowClust has been adapted for the current FCM data format, and integrated with existing Bioconductor packages dedicated to FCM analysis. CONCLUSION: flowClust addresses the issue of a dearth of software that helps automate FCM analysis with a sound theoretical foundation. It tends to give reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in FCM analysis. The package contributes to the cytometry community by offering an efficient, automated analysis platform which facilitates the active, ongoing technological advancement.},

abstract = {Metabolism is a fundamental process in ecosystems that crosses multiple scales of organization from individual organisms to whole ecosystems. To improve sharing and reuse of published metabolism models, we developed LakeM- etabolizer, an R package for estimating lake metabolism from in situ time series of dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and, optionally, additional environmental variables. LakeMetabolizer implements 5 different metabolism models with diverse statistical underpinnings: bookkeeping, ordinary least squares, maximum likelihood, Kalman filter, and Bayesian. Each of these 5 metabolism models can be combined with 1 of 7 models for computing the coefficient of gas exchange across the air–water interface (k). LakeMetabolizer also features a variety of supporting functions that compute conversions and implement calculations commonly applied to raw data prior to estimating metabolism (e.g., oxygen saturation and optical conversion models). These tools have been organized into an R package that contains example data, example use-cases, and function documentation. The release package version is available on the Com- prehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), and the full open-source GPL-licensed code is freely available for examination and extension online. With this unified, open-source, and freely available package, we hope to improve access and facilitate the application of metabolism in studies and management of lentic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Reservoirs account for about 10{\%} of the freshwater stored in lakes worldwide. These reservoirs are home to ‘reservoir ecosystems', that is, the aquatic and non-aquatic interactive ecosystems associated with artificial lakes where water is stored, typically behind a dam, for human purposes. While reservoir ecosystems provide various ecosystem services for sustainable development, their significance in research and policy has not been well understood and not well defined in the 2030 United Nation's (UN) Agenda for Sustainable Development. To advance understanding of reservoir ecosystems and their impact on policy, here we provide an overview of research on reservoir ecosystems and link it to UN SDGs and their Targets. Based on 5280 articles published in the last three decades, we applied network visualization to construct a framework for research addressing reservoir ecosystems. The framework covers four major themes: (1) ecosystem structure and function, (2) environmental pollution and stress effects, (3) climate impacts and ecological feedbacks, and (4) ecosystem services and management. We have found that sustainable reservoir ecosystems synergistically support 121 Targets of UN SDGs (71{\%} of all). Reservoir ecosystems have both negative and positive implications for 15 targets (9{\%}) and negative trade-offs for only 3 targets (2{\%}). Thirty SDG Targets (18{\%}) are unrelated to sustainable reservoir ecosystems. The synergies and trade-offs exist in three fields, securing basic material needs (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 14 and 15), pursuing common human well-being (SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10), and coordinating sustainable governance policies (SDGs 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17). Exploring these linkages allows better integration of reservoir ecosystems into the UN SDGs framework and guides sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems for sustainable development.},

abstract = {This study presents the first annual estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) of contrasting Danish agricultural peatlands. Studies were done at eight sites representing permanent grasslands (PG) and rotational (RT) arable soils cropped to barley, potato or forage grasses in three geo-regional settings. Using an advanced flux-chamber technique, NEE was derived from modelling of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP) with temperature and photosynthetically active radiation as driving variables. At PG (n=3) and RT (n=5) sites, NEE (mean±standard error, SE) was 5.1±0.9 and 8.6±2.0MgCha-1yr-1, respectively, but with the overall lowest value observed for potato cropping (3.5MgCha-1yr-1). This was partly attributed to a short-duration vegetation period and drying of the soil especially in potato ridges. NECB, derived from NEE and C-removal in harvested biomass, was equivalent to 8.4±1.0 and 11.5±2.0MgCha-1 for the PG and RT land-use types, respectively. Means were not significantly different, P=0.214, and were comparable to a wider range of high-end emission factors for managed organic soils in boreal and temperate climate zones. It was stressed that evaluation of emission factors should explicitly differentiate between data representing net C balance from a soil perspective and CO2-C balance from an atmospheric perspective. Modelling of inter-annual variability in NEE for three selected sites during a 21-year meteorological period indicated a range of 18-67{\%} (coefficients of variation). Yet, the robustness of these estimates and their importance for the derived emission factors needs to be substantiated experimentally. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The episodic nature of water availability in arid and semiarid ecosystems has significant consequences on belowground carbon and nutrient cycling. Pulsed water events directly control belowground processes through soil wet-dry cycles. Rapid soil microbial response to incident moisture availability often results in almost instantaneous C and N mineralization, followed by shifts in C/N of microbially available substrate, and an offset in the balance between nutrient immobilization and mineralization. Nitrogen inputs from biological soil crusts are also highly sensitive to pulsed rain events, and nitrogen losses, particularly gaseous losses due to denitrification and nitrate leaching, are tightly linked to pulses of water availability. The magnitude of the effect of water pulses on carbon and nutrient pools, however, depends on the distribution of resource availability and soil organisms, both of which are strongly affected by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of vegetation cover, topographic position and soil texture. The 'inverse texture hypothesis' for net primary production in water-limited ecosystems suggests that coarse-textured soils have higher NPP than fine-textured soils in very arid zones due to reduced evaporative losses, while NPP is greater in fine-textured soils in higher rainfall ecosystems due to increased water-holding capacity. With respect to belowground processes, fine-textured soils tend to have higher water-holding capacity and labile C and N pools than coarse-textured soils, and often show a much greater flush of N mineralization. The result of the interaction of texture and pulsed rainfall events suggests a corollary hypothesis for nutrient turnover in arid and semiarid ecosystems with a linear increase of N mineralization in coarse-textured soils, but a saturating response for fine-textured soils due to the importance of soil C and N pools. Seasonal distribution of water pulses can lead to the accumulation of mineral N in the dry season, decoupling resource supply and microbial and plant demand, and resulting in increased losses via other pathways and reduction in overall soil nutrient pools. The asynchrony of resource availability, particularly nitrogen versus water due to pulsed water events, may be central to understanding the consequences for ecosystem nutrient retention and long-term effects on carbon and nutrient pools. Finally, global change effects due to changes in the nature and size of pulsed water events and increased asynchrony of water availability and growing season will likely have impacts on biogeochemical cycling in water-limited ecosystems. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

Little attention has been paid to the influence of variability in wind speed on the calculated gas transfer velocities and the possibility of chemical enhancement of CO2 exchange at low wind speeds over the ocean. The effect of these parameters is illustrated using a quadratic dependence of gas exchange on wind speed which is fit through gas transfer velocities over the ocean determined by the natural-14C disequilibrium and the bomb-14C inventory methods. -from Author},

abstract = {Size spectra exhibit common patterns of variation and predictable responses to pressures across ecosystem types, functional guilds and taxonomic groups. Here, we extend the size spectra approach to phytoplankton ecological status assessment in transitional waters by developing, testing and validating a multi-metric index of size spectra sensitivity (ISS-phyto), which integrates size structure metrics with others such as phytoplankton diversity, biomass and sensitivity of size classes to anthropogenic disturbance. The ability of various theoretical models of size spectra sensitivity to discriminate between disturbed and undisturbed ecosystems and levels of anthropogenic stress was evaluated. We used data on phytoplankton samples collected in 14 Mediterranean and Black sea transitional water ecosystems (coastal lagoons) from Italy, Albania, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania, and compared the models' efficiency by looking at their pressure-impact response along salinity and enrichment gradients, the latter quantified as variations in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP). Data from a fifteenth Mediterranean lagoon was used for external validation purposes. Right asymmetric models of size class sensitivity, implying higher sensitivity of smaller cell size classes, were found to contribute to the ISS-phyto multimetric tool more effectively than symmetric and left asymmetric models, distinguishing disturbed from undisturbed lagoons and disturbed from undisturbed stations within the same lagoon. When based on right asymmetric sensitivity models, i.e., those that were most efficient in identifying anthropogenic impacts, ISS-phyto also showed the best fit of pressure-response relationships along the salinity and enrichment gradients; at low to high levels of impact ISS response was driven by size class sensitivity and at very high impacts by phytoplankton biomass. A scheme for the classification of Ecological Quality Status based on ISS-phyto is proposed and validated. The validation procedure found that ISS-phyto is an effective and sensitive monitoring tool, robust, easy to apply and to inter-calibrate among laboratories. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Pelagic calcification shapes the carbon budget of lakes and the sensitivity of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) responses to lake metabolism. This process, being tightly linked to primary production, needs to be understood within the context of summer eutrophication which is increasing due to human stressors and global change. Most lake carbon budget models do not account for calcification because the conditions necessary for its occurrence are not well constrained. This study aims at identifying ratios between calcification and primary production and the drivers that control these ratios in freshwater. Using in situ incubations in several European freshwater lakes, we identify a strong relationship between calcite saturation and the ratio between calcification and net ecosystem production (NEP) (p-value {\textless} 0.001, R2 = 0.95). NEP-induced calcification is a short-term process that is potentiated by the increase in calcite saturation occurring at longer time scales, usually reaching the highest levels in summer. The resulting summer calcification event has effects on the DIC equilibria, causing deviations from the metabolic 1:1 stoichiometry between DIC and dissolved oxygen (DO). The strong dependency of the ratio between NEP and calcification on calcite saturation can be used to develop a suitable parameterization to account for calcification in lake carbon budgets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Charles Elton introduced the “pyramid of numbers” in the late 1920s, but this remarkable insight into body-size dependent patterns in natural communities lay fallow until the theory of the biomass size spectrum was introduced by aquatic ecologists in the mid-1960s. They noticed that the summed biomass concentration of individual aquatic organisms was roughly constant across equal logarithmic intervals of body size from bacteria to the largest predators. These observations formed the basis for a theory of aquatic ecosystems, based on the body size of individual organisms, that revealed new insights into constraints on the structure of biological communities. In this review, we discuss the history of the biomass spectrum and the development of underlying theories. We indicate how to construct biomass spectra from sample data, explain the mathematical relations among them, show empirical examples of their various forms, and give details on how to statistically fit the most robust linear and nonlinear models ...},

Here, we evaluated 50 years of observational data, from 1966 to 2015, for ten European lakes to quantify changes in the annual maximum surface temperature and the duration above a potentially critical temperature of 20 °C. Our results show that annual maximum lake surface temperature has increased at an average rate of +0.58 °C decade−1 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.18), which is similar to the observed increase in annual maximum air temperature of +0.42 °C decade−1 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.28) over the same period. Increments in lake maximum temperature among the ten lakes range from +0.1 in the west to +1.9 °C decade−1 in the east. Absolute maximum lake surface water temperatures were reached in W{\"{o}}rthersee, 27.5 °C, and Neusiedler See, 31.7 °C. Periods exceeding a critical temperature of 20 °C each year became two to six times longer than the respective average (6 to 93). The depth at which water temperature exceeded 20 °C increased from less than 1 to more than 6 m in Mondsee, Austria, over the 50 years studied. As a consequence, the habitable environment became increasingly restricted for many organisms that are adapted to historic conditions.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (OM) is an important factor for maintaining the productivity and the stability of the so-called Caldenal woodland ecosystem of central Argentina. Little is known about the influence of tree coverage and soil texture on OM accumulation in soils of the study region. The relationships between OM content, silt clay content, and the percent of tree coverage were studied in a 25 × 25 m grid in 2 sites. Results showed that OM was lower (P {\textless} 0.05) at Site I (2.86{\%}) than at Site II (6.41{\%}). The OM was positively correlated with the percent of tree coverage in Site I (OM = 0.0156 trees cover 1.97, R2 = 0.29, P {\textless} 0.001), but not in Site II. Conversely, a positive correlation with silt clay was observed in Site II (OM = 0.17 silt clay − 6.79, R2 = 0.41, P {\textless} 0.05) but not in Site I. A multiple regression analysis [OM = − 16.64 0.71 (silt clay) 0.04 (tree coverage), n = 78, R2 = 0.55, P {\textless} 0.001] tended to confirm these results. Although they differed in their relative weight both silt clay and tree coverage affect OM accumulation at both sites. The larger influence of trees on OM variability at Site I was attributed to the lower, but highly variable, tree coverage, and the stronger influence of silt clay on OM variability at Site II can be attributed to the lower variability of tree coverage, and the higher variability of soil texture.According to our results, (a) 41{\%} of OM variability is explained by silt clay content when tree coverage is dense and uniform, and (b) a 29{\%} of OM variability is explained by tree coverage when such coverage is sparse and heterogeneous. The influence of tree canopy on OM distribution could be explained by its effect on the temperature regime. The influence of soil texture on OM could be attributed to its effect on the water retention capacity of soils. While forest clearing increases the maximum temperature and the temperature amplitude of soils, erosion in cleared areas affects soil texture, and consequently, its water retention capacity. The deterioration of both temperature and soil water regimes deteriorates, in turn, the capacity of the soil to accumulate OM.},

abstract = {The seasonal variation in oxidized and reduced pools of Mn, Fe and S, as well as the rates of SO42- reduction, were studied in a fine-grained sediment. Below the 1-5 mm thick oxic zone, a zone of net Mn reduction extended to 1-2 cm depth, while iron reduction was found to 4-6 cm depth. Although the reactive Mn oxide pool was ten times smaller than the reactive Fe(III) pool, the average ratio between depth gradients of Fe and Mn oxides was only 1.7, which implied that rates of Mn and Fe reduction were similar. Sulfate reduction was maximal near the bottom of the suboxic zone, but fine-scale measurements showed that it extended to the upper 0-2.5 mm during summer, when the zones of Mn and Fe reduction were compressed towards the surface. Most of the H2S produced precipitated as iron sulfides and S0 by reaction with Fe. Both Fe(III) and a nonsulfur-bound authigenic Fe(II) pool reacted efficiently with H2S. The authigenic Fe(II) pool was present at one hundredfold higher concentration than dissolved Fe2+. Only 15{\%} of the precipitated sulfide was buried permanently. Most of the reoxidation of reduced S occurred within 1 cm of the sediment-water interface and was supported by upward bioturbation. All of the estimated Mn reduction could be coupled to the reoxidation of reduced S and Fe. Partial oxidation of H2S, forming S0 and pyrite, accounted for 63{\%} of the estimated Fe reduction. The remaining Fe reduction was coupled to complete oxidation of reduced S or to C mineralization. The settling of a diatom spring bloom caused distinct maxima in SRR and Mn2+ at 0.5-1 cm depth within two weeks. In autumn, the reactive Mn oxides were depleted due to a net release of Mn2+ to the water column. Thus, the Mn cycle extended significantly into the water column, while a constant Fe pool over the year suggests that the Fe cycle was restricted to the sediment. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Measurements of the production and consumption of organic material have been a focus of aquatic science for more than 80 years. Over the last century, a variety of approaches have been developed and employed for measuring rates of gross primary production (Pg), respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (Pn = Pg − R) within aquatic ecosystems. Here, we reconsider the range of approaches and applications for ecosystem metabolism measurements, and suggest ways by which such studies can continue to contribute to aquatic ecology. This paper reviews past and contemporary studies of aquatic ecosystem-level metabolism to identify their role in understanding and managing aquatic systems. We identify four broad research objectives that have motivated ecosystem metabolism studies: (1) quantifying magnitude and variability of metabolic rates for cross-system comparison, (2) estimating organic matter transfer between adjacent systems or subsystems, (3) measuring ecosystem-scale responses to perturbation, both natural and anthropogenic, and (4) quantifying and calibrating models of biogeochemical processes and trophic networks. The magnitudes of whole-system gross primary production, respiration and net ecosystem production rates vary among aquatic environments and are partly constrained by the chosen methodology. We argue that measurements of ecosystem metabolism should be a vital component of routine monitoring at larger scales in the aquatic environment using existing flexible, precise, and durable sensor technologies. Current and future aquatic ecosystem studies will benefit from application of new methods for metabolism measurements, which facilitate integration of process measurements and calibration of models for addressing fundamental questions involving ecosystem-scale processes.},

abstract = {Thermal stratification is crucial for water quality and ecological processes in deep lakes and reservoirs and can be substantially affected by meteorological and hydrological processes in the catchment. However, how thermal stratification responds to rainfalls of different intensities and changing hydrological processes has not been documented very well. Here, high frequency water column profiles at three stations in a large subtropical deep reservoir (Lake Qiandaohu, China) in 2017 were used to elucidate the impacts of rainfall on lake physical process and chemical environment. The impact of rainfalls on the thermal stratification and dissolved oxygen in riverine zone was more impressive than that in transitional and lacustrine zones. The effect on thermal stratification by rainfall was largely affected by the magnitude of rainfall. Moderate and heavy rainfall events could reduce the thermal stability of water column, deepen the mixing layer depth, and shape the thermocline, resulting from decrease of surface water temperature and increased inflows. While rainstorms could totally break up thermoclines in the riverine zone by high volume inflow flushing. In addition, we found that the hypoxia and anoxia initial depths increased during rainfall events in this reservoir, which were well related to the changes of mixing layer depths. This research highlights that quantifying the effects of rainfalls on thermal stratification and dissolved oxygen will be beneficial for optimizing reservoir management.},

abstract = {Recent advances in open-water measurements suggest significant temporal and spatial variability of gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and respiration (R) with implications for understanding carbon cycling in lakes. This study applied high-frequency depth profiles in three stratified lakes of different trophic status to investigate (1) the importance of vertical variations in metabolic rates, (2) the effects of changes in the depth of the mixed layer (Zmix) and the photic zone (Zeu), and (3) the photoacclimative responses of the aquatic autotrophs to changes in these conditions. Taking account of vertical differences in metabolism improved the reliability of whole-areal NEP estimates during stratification. Whereas the hypolimnion was always heterotrophic, and the epilimnion was mostly autotrophic, the metalimnion had NEP . 0 when Zeu . Zmix. Although most of GPP and R occurred in the epilimnion, between 0{\%} and 20{\%} of GPP and 4{\%} and 37{\%} of R took place in the metalimnion. Areal metabolic estimates based on surface measurements deviated up to 60{\%} for GPP and 80{\%}for R when Zeu . Zmix. The vertical variability in metabolism was driven by available light in both the epi- and metalimnion. Coupling between GPP and R was low in all layers and indicated increasing background R with depth. Light utilization efficiency was significantly higher under low light conditions, indicating photophysiological acclimation of phytoplankton to decreasing light in the metalimnion. Measurements},

@article{Kremer2017,
abstract = {Quantifying how environmental factors control the growth of phytoplankton communities is essential for building a mechanistic understanding of global biogeochemical cycles and aquatic food web dynamics. The strong effects of temperature on population growth rate have inspired two frameworks—the Eppley curve and the metabolic theory of ecology—that produce different quantitative relationships and employ distinct statistical approaches. Reconciling these relationships is necessary to ensure the accuracy of ecosystem mod-els. In this paper, we develop ways to compare these frameworks, overcoming their methodological differ-ences. Then, analyzing an extensive dataset ({\textgreater} 4200 growth rate measurements), we find that increases in population growth rate with temperature are consistent with metabolic theory, and weaker than previous estimates of the Eppley curve. A 108C temperature increase will increase growth rates by a factor of 1.53, rath-er than 1.88 as in previous studies of the Eppley curve. Size and functional group membership are also criti-cal. Population growth rates decrease with size, but much less strongly that metabolic theory predicts. The growth rates of different functional groups scale similarly with temperature, but some groups grow faster than others, independent of temperature. Our results reconcile the analytical methods of the Eppley curve and metabolic theory, demonstrate that metabolic theory's temperature-scaling predictions are more accu-rate, and provide new insights into the factors controlling phytoplankton growth. To avoid over-estimating the effects of temperature on primary productivity, the parameterization of ecosystem models should be revised.},

abstract = {1. Body size determines rates of respiration and production, energy requirements, mortality rates, patterns of predation and vulnerability to mortality. Body size distributions are often used to describe structure and energy flux in communities and ecosystems. 2. If clear relationships can be established between body size and trophic level in fishes, they may provide a basis for integrating community and ecosystem analyses based on size spectra, food webs and life histories. 3. We investigated relationships between the body sizes (weight and length) of northeast Atlantic fishes and their trophic level. The abundance of N-15, as determined by stable isotope analysis, was used as an index of trophic level. 4. Cross- species and comparative analyses demonstrated that body size was unrelated or weakly related to trophic level. Thus allometric relationships between body size and trophic level could not be used to predict the trophic structure of fish communities. 5. The results of the cross-species analyses contrasted with patterns in the size and trophic structure of entire fish communities. When fish communities were divided into size classes, there were strong positive relationships between size class and trophic level. The slope suggested a mean predator : prey body mass ratio of 80 : 1. 6. Our results suggest that body size does not provide a useful surrogate of trophic level for individual species, but that body size is an excellent predictor of trophic level within the community, providing an empirical basis for integrating community analyses based on models of trophic structure and body size distributions.},

abstract = {The present study describes the fluxes and transports of nutrients and chlorophyll a inferred from direct observations carried out off south Portugal, during a research cruise in early October 2006. The covered area corresponds to the western part of the northern margin of the Gulf of Cadiz, from Cape S{\~{a}}o Vicente (9.0°W) till the Guadiana River mouth (7.4°W). Unlike in the western Iberian margin, the upwelling in this region is rather intermittent during the summer season. It is interleaved by periods when warm waters coming from the eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz occupy the coastal region. However, our observations were taken during an intense upwelling event that took place at the end of the upwelling season. Ten meridional transects were sampled in a total of 90 CTD casts. Current velocity profiles were acquired along the ship's track with a hull-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). The analysis of the circulation field and water masses characteristics led to the quantification of the fluxes and transports of chlorophyll a and nutrients in 5 meridional transects along the coast. Results show the prevalence of the alongshore eastward flow over the offshore Ekman transport in the coastal circulation without formation of upwelling filaments. Transport of chlorophyll a showed a near surface maximum ({\textless}30dbar), while transport of nutrients were generally higher in the layer below (30–100dbar). The estimates show net eastward alongshore transports of chlorophyll a and nutrients into the Gulf of Cadiz and weak cross-shore exchanges. At the deepest levels, the estimates of the transports by the shallow vein of the Mediterranean Water show an important input of nutrients to the Atlantic. However, waters in the top 100dbar, impoverished in nutrients by biological utilisation due to upwelling, show that nitrate and phosphate transports provided into the Gulf of Cadiz exceed those carried westward by the shallow vein of the Mediterranean Water.},

abstract = {Human population growth, economic development, climate change, and the need to close the electricity access gap have stimulated the search for new sources of renewable energy. In response to this need, major new initiatives in hydropower development are now under way. At least 3,700 major dams, each with a capacity of more than 1 MW, are either planned or under construction, primarily in countries with emerging economies. These dams are predicted to increase the present global hydroelectricity capacity by 73 {\%} to about 1,700 GW. Even such a dramatic expansion in hydropower capacity will be insufficient to compensate for the increasing electricity demand. Furthermore, it will only partially close the electricity gap, may not substantially reduce greenhouse gas emission (carbon dioxide and methane), and may not erase interdependencies and social conflicts. At the same time, it is certain to reduce the number of our planet's remaining free-flowing large rivers by about 21 {\%}. Clearly, there is an urgent need to evaluate and to mitigate the social, economic, and ecological ramifications of the current boom in global dam construction.},

abstract = {Sediment accumulation in lakes provides a small but permanent carbon sink. To date, global estimates of the C cycle have barely considered variations in lake carbon burial. To improve the understanding of carbon storage in lakes this study analyzed the sedimentary record of 228 European lakes concerning long-term carbon burial and its correlation to lake and catchment properties. The results suggest that carbon mass accumulations in small lakes are significantly lower than those used for global estimates so far. On the other hand, the total surface area of small lakes has been severely underestimated. Results from calculations based on a Pareto distribution show that total lake surface is 240,000 km2 in Europe. We estimate total C burial in European lakes at 1.25 Mt yr-1. Half this storage takes place in boreal lakes of northern Europe, although they contribute up to 65{\%} to the European lake surface. This is due to generally lower carbon burial rates in this region. Carbon mass accumulation rates increased in many lakes between 5000 to 2000 years BP. This coincides with increased clastic inputs due to land use change, i.e., increasing cropland coverage and soil erosion. On average, carbon accumulation rates are twice as high in younger sediments at 20 cm depth when compared to the long-term mean. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {In the summer of 1989 vertical profiles of chlorophyll a were taken in the North Atlantic. Stations were located along a transect following longitude 20-degrees-W, between 60 and 33-degrees-N. Maximum chlorophyll a levels were located near the surface in the north (2 mugl-1) but became gradually deeper towards the south (0.3 mug l-1 at a depth of 80-110m). Primary production varied only by a factor of 2.3 (226-533 mg C m-2 day-1), whereas the assimilation ratio showed far less variation (15.46 +/- 4.61 mg C mg Chl-1 day-1, n = 14). The northern part of the transect showed no thermal stratification, and nutrients were plentiful. Phytoplankton was distributed homogeneously, with a nearly constant signature of the cellular fluorescence characteristics as monitored by flow-cytometry. The dominant taxa were small prymnesiophytes (Emiliania huxleyi) and chroococcoid phycoerythrin-containing cyanobacteria. Cells were healthy, resulting in net growth rates (growth rate minus grazing) of up to 0.75 divisions per day. Of the total primary production, 68{\%} was actually converted into new plant carbon. Midway along the transect (47-degrees-N) there was a sharp thermocline at a depth of 35 m. All nutrients (nitrogen, phosphate and silicate) were depleted in the upper water layer. Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community in numbers varying from 12,000 to 39,000 cells ml-1. Stabilization of the water column was apparently in progress, as could be derived from the gradual increase in mean cellular red fluorescence of the cyanobacteria with depth. Furthermore, net growth rates of the algae were relatively low, as was the proportion of primary production resulting in an actual increase of plant carbon (42{\%}). At the southernmost station (33-degrees-N), the situation was typical of the oligotrophic subtropics: a sharp thermocline at 35 m, the 0.1{\%} surface incident irradiance level at 150 m, and a nitracline at a depth of 100-120m. The most prominent (pico)plankters present were prochlorophytes, predominantly at the deep chlorophyll maximum (80-100 m, up to 95,000 cells ml-1). Cyanobacteria co-occurred but only in small numbers (maximum of 5500 ml-1), mainly in surface waters. The vertical (physical) stability of the water column was pronounced, and the mean cellular red fluorescence signal of cells found at the bottom of the euphotic zone was consequently higher than in surface waters. Most remarkable were the net growth rates of the various species suggesting a highly dynamic phytoplankton community. Extreme growth rates included positive as well as negative values, which were not always consistent with the greatest abundance of certain species.

abstract = {Ebullition (bubbling) is an important mechanism for the transfer of methane (CH4) from shallow waters to the atmosphere. Because of their stochastic nature, however, ebullition fluxes are difficult to accurately resolve. Hydroacoustic surveys have the potential to significantly improve the spatiotemporal observation of emission fluxes, but knowledge of bubble size distribution is also necessary to accurately assess local, regional, and global water body CH4 emission estimates. Therefore, we explore the importance of bubble size and small-scale flux variability on CH4 transport in and emissions from a reservoir with a bubble-size-calibrated echosounder that can efficiently and economically survey greater areas while still resolving individual bubbles. Using a postprocessing method that resolves bubble density, we found that the largest 10{\%} of the {\textgreater}6700 observed bubbles were responsible for more than 65{\%} of the total CH4 transport. Furthermore, the asymmetry of CH4 ebullition flux distribution and the high spatial heterogeneity of those fluxes suggests that inadvertently omitting emission hot spots (i.e., areas of high flux) could lead to significant underestimations of CH4 emissions from localized areas and potentially from entire water bodies. While the bubble sizes resolved by the hydroacoustic method may provide insight into the factors controlling ebullition (e.g., sediment type, carbon sedimentation), the better resolution of small-scale CH4 emission hot spots afforded by hydroacoustics will bring us closer to the true CH4 emission estimates from all shallow waters, be them lakes, reservoirs, or coastal oceans and seas.},

abstract = {We assessed the spatial variability in both, surface carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and in pelagic respiration rates in a newly created 600-km2 boreal reservoir, located in Northern Quebec. We show that total CO2 emission to the atmosphere was highest in the first year after flooding, and that surface fluxes were spatially heterogeneous. This spatial heterogeneity was not random, but was linked to the pre-flood landscapes: reservoir areas overlying former peatbogs and mature forests had the highest average emissions, whereas areas overlying former non-forest and burned soils had the lowest emissions. Total reservoir emissions appeared to decline exponentially in the next 2 years, and so did the degree of spatial heterogeneity in surface fluxes, suggesting a progressive weakening of the link to the pre-flood landscapes, and a homogenization of reservoir processes. We show that pelagic respiration rates were also initially high and spatially heterogeneous, the latter linked to the pre-flood landscapes. A simple, first-order mass balance for the first 3 years after flooding was used to derive potential benthic CO2 production rates, and thus to apportion the total reservoir emissions between its pelagic and benthic components. Extrapolation of the observed declines (normal exponential) in total emission, as well as of the underlying pelagic and benthic fluxes, results in a large underestimation of the fluxes for the fourth year, relative to the measured emissions. We postulate that the initial exponential decline in total emissions is driven primarily by the patterns of decomposition of surface plant biomass, whereas at later stages emission is increasingly dominated by sediment and pelagic respiration, which decline in time at a slower rate. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Lakes hold much of Earth's accessible liquid freshwater, support biodiversity and provide key ecosystem services to people around the world. However, they are vulnerable to climate change, for example through shorter durations of ice cover, or through rising lake surface temperatures. Here we use a one-dimensional numerical lake model to assess climate change impacts on mixing regimes in 635 lakes worldwide. We run the lake model with input data from four state-of-the-art model projections of twenty-first-century climate under two emissions scenarios. Under the scenario with higher emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0), many lakes are projected to have reduced ice cover; about one-quarter of seasonally ice-covered lakes are projected to be permanently ice-free by 2080–2100. Surface waters are projected to warm, with a median warming across lakes of about 2.5 °C, and the most extreme warming about 5.5 °C. Our simulations suggest that around 100 of the studied lakes are projected to undergo changes in their mixing regimes. About one-quarter of these 100 lakes are currently classified as monomictic—undergoing one mixing event in most years— and will become permanently stratified systems. About one-sixth of these are currently dimictic—mixing twice per year—and will become monomictic. We conclude that many lakes will mix less frequently in response to climate change.},

abstract = {Water scarcity severely impairs food security and economic prosperity in many countries today. Expected future population changes will, in many countries as well as globally, increase the pressure on available water resources. On the supply side, renewable water resources will be affected by projected changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and other climate variables. Here we use a large ensemble of global hydrological models (GHMs) forced by five global climate models and the latest greenhouse-gas concentration scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways) to synthesize the current knowledge about climate change impacts on water resources. We show that climate change is likely to exacerbate regional and global water scarcity considerably. In particular, the ensemble average projects that a global warming of 2 °C above present (approximately 2.7 °C above preindustrial) will confront an additional approximate 15{\%} of the global population with a severe decrease in water resources and will increase the number of people living under absolute water scarcity ({\textless}500 m3 per capita per year) by another 40{\%} (according to some models, more than 100{\%}) compared with the effect of population growth alone. For some indicators of moderate impacts, the steepest increase is seen between the present day and 2 °C, whereas indicators of very severe impacts increase unabated beyond 2 °C. At the same time, the study highlights large uncertainties associated with these estimates, with both global climate models and GHMs contributing to the spread. GHM uncertainty is particularly dominant in many regions affected by declining water resources, suggesting a high potential for improved water resource projections through hydrological model development.},

However, lakes with appreciable levels of dissolved organic material, including those found on the Canadian Precambrian Shield (DOC levels 1.4-12.41 mg l-1), have seldom been included in these models. Our analysis suggests that for such lakes, thermocline depth is linked strongly to light penetration (Secchi depth r = 0.83, light extinction r = -0.85) which is strongly related to DOC concentration (Secchi depth r = -0.91, light extinction r = 0.97). A multivariate regression based on small Canadian Shield lakes suggests that DOC is the most important predictor of thermocline depth. Maximum effective length, maximum depth, and chlorophyll a contribute significantly to the prediction power of the regression model, but are of secondary importance in the presence of DOC.},

abstract = {The relation between productivity, O2 and organic carbon preservation has been the subject of great controversy. One theory has been that anoxic decomposition of organic matter is intrinsically slower than oxic decomposition and thus results in the accumulation of organic carbon in anoxic sediments and waters. However, several past studies suggest that differences in the intrinsic rates of decomposition between the two types of systems are small. Here, I provide further evidence of this by measuring microbial metabolism of individual radiolabeled compounds in the oxic and anoxic waters of stratified water bodies. The lack of a rate difference suggests the need for further explanation of the controls on carbon preservation. The concept is presented that anoxic sediments may sequester organic matter as bacterial biomass, or as bacterially derived products, in the absence of bacterial grazers. Thus, differences in the numbers and diversity of organisms that graze upon bacteria between oxic and anoxic sediments may explain part of the difference in carbon preservation rates that have been observed between the two types of systems. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {We explored the whole-lake accumulation of CO2 during winter ice cover and in the hypolimnion during summer stratification, in 15 temperate and boreal lakes, and how these processes vary with lake trophic state and morphometry. We further estimated an annual CO2 budget for each lake that incorporates the fluxes resulting from winter ice-cover and summer hypolimnetic CO2 accumulation to assess their relative importance. The volumetric rates of CO2 accumulation during the winter ice cover ranged from 4.1 to 42.1 mg C m−3 d−1, and from 9.3 to 54.5 mg C m−3 d−1 in the summer hypolimnion, and both varied mainly as a function of water temperature. The total CO2 accumulation at the end of winter/summer was most strongly related to lake mean depth and was significantly greater under ice than in the hypolimnion. This greater CO2 accumulation resulted in relatively high and unvarying spring outflux, averaging 404 mg C m−2 d−1 (C.V. 27{\%}). Significant hypolimnetic CO2 accumulation also resulted in relatively high fluxes (average 228 mg C m−2 d−1) during autumnal mixing, which were more variable (C.V. 43{\%}) than spring fluxes. Average fluxes were lowest and most variable in summer (198 mg C m−2 d−1, C.V. 46{\%}). The net annual CO2 flux ranged from 14 to 68 g C m−2 y−1, and was positively related to DOC concentration. The winter ice-cover CO2 accumulation accounted from 3 to 80{\%} (average 17{\%}) of the annual CO2 flux, whereas summer hypolimnetic accumulation accounted for a smaller but still significant proportion (from 1.4 to 46{\%}). These winter and summer hypolimnetic CO2 accumulations are released to the atmosphere through short but intense emission bursts that are rarely captured in regular lake sampling schemes, yet they have the potential to profoundly influence the annual lake CO2 budgets in northern landscapes.},

A Critical Review of Methods for Analyzing Freshwater Eutrophication. Water 2021, 13, 225. Abstract: Water eutrophication is a global environmental problem that poses serious threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. The evaluation of eutrophication provides a theoretical basis and technical guidance for the management and rehabilitation of water ecosystems. In the last four decades, dozens of evaluation methods have been applied to freshwater eutrophication, but there is a clear need to optimize and standardize the most suitable methods. We have addressed this gap by presenting a systematic review of methodologies. Due to the diversity and complexity of water bodies, no single evaluation method was identified that would adequately represent eutrophication under all scenarios. We demonstrate that lakes can best be assessed using the trophic level index (TLI) method, reservoirs and wetlands the trophic state index (TSI) and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method, respectively, and rivers the FCE method or back propagation (BP) neural network methods. More recently applied methodologies including spectral imaging and 3-D mapping of water quality using underwater gliders allow greater resolution and can be effective in managing waterbodies to avoid future eutrophication. The aim of this review is to guide future studies on the most appropriate methods available for assessing and reporting water eutrophication.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Fluxes of CO2 are important for our understanding of the global carbon cycle and greenhouse gas balances. Several significant CO2 fluxes in nature may still be unknown as illustrated by recent findings of high CO2 emissions from aquatic environments, previously not recognized in global carbon balances. Therefore, it is important to develop convenient and affordable ways to measure CO2 in many types of environments. At present, direct measurements of CO2 fluxes from soil or water, or CO2 concentrations in surface water, are typically labor intensive or require costly equipment. We here present an approach with measurement units based on small inexpensive CO2 loggers, originally made for indoor air quality monitoring, that were tested and adapted for field use. Measurements of soil–atmosphere and lake–atmosphere fluxes, as well as of spatiotemporal dynamics of water CO2 concentrations (expressed as the equivalent partial pressure, pCO2aq) in lakes and a stream network are provided as examples. Results from all these examples indicate that this approach can provide a cost- and labor-efficient alternative for direct measurements and monitoring of CO2 flux and pCO2aq in terrestrial and aquatic environments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We have examined the inter- and intra-group seasonal succession of 113 diatom and dinoflagellate taxa, as surveyed by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) in the North Atlantic, by grouping taxa according to two key functional traits: cell size (mg C cell21) and trophic strategy (photoautotrophy, mixotrophy, or heterotrophy). Mixotrophic dinoflagellates follow photoautotrophic diatoms but precede their obligate heterotrophic counterparts in the succession because of the relative advantages afforded by photosynthesizing when light and nutrients are available in spring. The mean cell size of the sampled diatoms is smallest in the summer, likely because of the higher specific nutrient affinity of smaller relative to larger cells. Contrastingly, we hypothesize that mixotrophy diminishes the size selection based on nutrient limitation and accounts for the lack of a seasonal size shift among surveyed dinoflagellates. Relatively small, heterotrophic dinoflagellates (mg C cell21 , 1023) peak after other, larger dinoflagellates, in part because of the increased abundance of their small prey during nutrient- deplete summer months. The largest surveyed diatoms (mg C cell21 . 1022) bloom later than others, and we hypothesize that this may be because of their relatively slow maximum potential growth rates and high internal nutrient storage, as well as to the slower predation of these larger cells. The new trait database and analysis presented here helps translate the taxonomic information of the CPR survey into metrics that can be directly compared with trait-based models},

Negligible surface CH4 oxidation suggests that the produced 110 ± 60 nmol CH4 L−1 d−1 efficiently escapes to the atmosphere. Stable carbon isotope ratios indicate that CH4 in the SML is distinct from sedimentary CH4 production, suggesting alternative pathways and precursors.

abstract = {The upward transport of phosphorus through the lower portion of the metalimnion of hypereutrophic Onondaga Lake, mediated by vertical diffusivity, was estimated for a productive seven month period during 1980. This upward flux was simulated by Fickian diffusion, which incorporates estimates of the vertical diffusivity coefficient for heat and measurements of the vertical phosphorus gradient. The field and laboratory analytical program included thermal profiles and dissolved phosphorus fractions from depths bracketing the metalimnion. Samples were collected on 53 dates during the study period. Two different time segmentations, approximately semimonthly and monthly, were utilized in the determination of the vertical diffusivity coefficient. The turbulent component of vertical diffusivity demonstrated a strong seasonality during the stratification period, varying from 0.060 cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} sec{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in early summer to 0.002 cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}sec{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} during the maximum stability period of late summer.

abstract = {The patterns of spatial and temporal variability in CO2 and CH4 emission from reservoirs are still poorly studied, especially in tropical regions where hydropower is growing. We performed spatially resolved measurements of dissolved CO2 and CH4 surface water concentrations and their gas-exchange coefficients (k) to compute diffusive carbon flux from four contrasting tropical reservoirs across Brazil during different hydrological seasons. We used an online equilibration system to measure dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations; we estimated k from floating chamber deployments in conjunction with discrete CO2 and CH4 water concentration measurements. Diffusive CO2 emissions were higher during dry season than during rainy season, whereas there were no consistent seasonal patterns for diffusive CH4 emissions. Our results reveal that the magnitude and the spatial within-reservoir patterns of diffusive CO2 and CH4 flux varied strongly among hydrological seasons. River inflow areas were often characterized by high seasonality in diffusive flux. Areas close to the dam generally showed low seasonal variability in diffusive CH4 flux but high variability in CO2 flux. Overall, we found that reservoir areas exhibiting highest emission rates (“hotspots”) shifted substantially across hydrological seasons. Estimates of total diffusive carbon emission from the reservoir surfaces differed between hydrological seasons by a factor up to 7 in Chap{\'{e}}u D'{\'{U}}vas, up to 13 in Curu{\'{a}}-Una, up to 4 in Furnas, and up to 1.8 in Funil, indicating that spatially resolved measurements of CO2 and CH4 concentrations and k need to be performed at different hydrological seasons in order to constrain annual diffusive carbon emission.},

abstract = {For seven marine phytoplankton species, rates of net and gross O2 production (measured by the $\Delta$O2 and 18O techniques) and 14C assimilation were determined in laboratory incubations. The 14C experiments were conducted in culture medium that was either N2-purged, air-purged or unpurged. In all species, the rates of respiration in the light are observed to be similar to, or greater than, the rates in the dark. For several species, respiration rates increased in the light but there was no Warburg effect (enhancement of 14C productivities in N2-purged cultures), indicating that photoenhancement of respiration was not due to photorespiration. In a few species, significant rates of photorespiration were detected with the 14C method, corresponding to 20 to {\textgreater} 100{\%} of the rates of respiration in the light. The ratio of light respiration to production showed variable changes when phytoplankton were exposed to greater light intensities. These results suggest that phytoplankton do not necessarily increase rates of respiration when placed in an environment with increased irradiance. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

The study was undertaken after a major hydrological intervention in September 2000, which connected the lagoon body and the Bay of Bengal via a manmade opening (new mouth). Current and old data on water quality were also compared to establish the changes that had occurred after the hydrological intervention. Multivariate techniques and gridding methods were used to investigate the spatial and seasonal variability of the data and to characterize the trophic evolution of the basin. Results of principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the 27 stations can be classified into five groups based on similarities in the temporal variation of nutrients, chlorophyll a concentration, salinity, and other physicochemical parameters. The tributaries and the exchange of lagoon water with the Bay of Bengal most probably determine the water quality and the dynamics of the ecosystem. Hydrodynamics of the lagoon, weed coverage, input of urban sewage through tributaries and agricultural runoff are probably the key factors controlling the trophic conditions of the lagoon. An increase in salinity and total phosphorus was noted after the new mouth was opened, while the total suspended sediment load, the water column depth, and nitrogenous nutrients decreased. The new mouth opening also brought changes in the phytoplankton species composition.},

The relation between numerical abundance (N, organisms per ml) and body size (V, mum3) for the overall size spectrum is described by the model log N = 7.25-0.99 99 log V (r2 = 0.93). However, the existence of tendencies in the points around the regression line suggest limiting linear scaling to the size range of unicells (log N = 6.34-0.51 log V, r2 = 0.85). The size structure shows the less negative slope at the level of the thermocline and when the bloom of C. hirundinella reaches its maximum. In the epilimnion, important taxonomic changes have no effect on the size structure, which appears to be a conservative character of the planktonic community at this level.},

abstract = {In shallow coastal systems where most of the seafloor lies within the photic zone, benthic photoautotrophy is likely to play a key role in regulating carbon and nitrogen cycling. We measured dissolved inorganic carbon exchanges in seasonal microcosm incubations to determine the relative importance of benthic (with and without macroalgae) and water column metabolism at 3 sites located along a nutrient gradient in a coastal barrier-island lagoon on the eastern shore of Virginia. When coupled with data on in situ biomass, the incubations clearly indicated a seasonality in the dominance of primary producers at the sites, with benthic primary producers being the most important early and late in the growing season and phytoplankton dominating following a mid-summer period of macroalgal decay and the release of algal-bound nutrients to the water column. The benthos was always net autotrophic, and differences in community metabolism at the 3 sites appeared to be largely due to variation in macroalgal biomass. Macroalgae accumulated to a greater extent in the mid-lagoon and accounted for up to 96{\%} of benthic production. The water column was net heterotrophic throughout the lagoon except following the mid-summer macroalgal collapse, when phytoplankton biomass was highest at the 2 sites closest to the mainland. Benthic microalgal production also increased in importance following the macroalgal decline, suggesting that competition for light and possibly nutrients limited benthic microalgal production when macroalgal densities were high. Overall, there was a distinct seasonality in patterns of total metabolism within the bay, where all sites were net autotrophic in the spring and summer and net heterotrophic in the fall. Up to 8 g N m super(-2) accumulated in macroalgal biomass throughout spring and early summer at the mid-lagoon shoal site, slowing nutrient transport through the lagoon. Nutrient turnover rates were higher during the period when phytoplankton and benthic microalgae were the dominant primary producers. This study illustrates the functional importance of different primary producer communities to carbon metabolism and to the temporary retention of nutrients in lagoonal land-margin ecosystems.},

abstract = {Sediment organic carbon (C) burial and CO2 fluxes in inland waters are quantitatively important in regional and global carbon budgets. Estimates of C fluxes from inland waters are typically based on limited temporal resolution despite potential large variations with season and weather events. Further, most freshwater C budget studies have focused on natural soft-water lakes, while reservoirs and hard-water systems are globally numerous. Our study quantifies C fluxes in two hard-water, human constructed reservoirs (Ohio, USA) of contrasting watershed land use (agriculture vs. forest) using high-resolution mass balance budgets. We show that during a dry summer, C retention and export via the dam were reduced compared to a wet summer. Both reservoirs were net CO2 sources during a wet summer, but CO2 sinks during a dry summer. Despite weather-related summer differences, annual C fluxes within each reservoir were similar between years. Both reservoirs appear to be net autotrophic despite often being CO2 sources based on budgets. This is likely because CO2 fluxes in our hard-water reservoirs were more strongly associated with DIC than DOC. Using our C fluxes and statewide watershed land use, we determined the regional importance of Ohio reservoirs in OC burial and CO2 emissions. We estimate that Ohio reservoirs bury up to 4 times more OC, but emit {\textless}25{\%} of CO2, than predicted based on their area and recent global mean estimates in lentic ecosystems. Our results provide evidence that moderately old ({\~{}}50 years), temperate hard-water reservoirs are important OC sinks but contribute little to CO2 emissions. {\textcopyright}2013.

Simplified procedures based on correlation analysis, analytic solutions to the ordinary linearized differential equation describing the system, and a numerical model that solves the governing equation for multi-inlet, multi-basin systems are described. The models predict the inlet flow characteristics, basin surface elevation response, and pollutant concentrations for cases where the basin responds in a simple pumping or Helmholtz mode. To describe circulation and pollutant movement when the pumping mode assumption is inappropriate two-dimensional, vertically-averaged models based either on finite element or finite difference solution methodologies are presented. This approach is also employed when the specific interest is circulation or pollutant transport within the basin. A unique hybrid model, coupling a one dimensional inlet model with a two-dimensional, vertically-averaged model for the basin, is described. The use of boundary fitted coordinate models is explored exploiting their ability to accurately describe areas with disparate spatial scales. A procedure is presented to assist in model selection for inlet-lagoon systems. To demonstrate model application for management decision making a simplified approach is applied to predict the impacts of inlet channel modification on the circulation, flushing dynamics, and salinity in the Charlestown, R.I. pond system.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton size structure controls the trophic organization of planktonic communities and their ability to export biogenic materials toward the ocean's interior. Our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the variability in phytoplankton size structure has been shaped by the assumption that the pace of metabolism decreases allometrically with increasing cell size. However, recent field and laboratory evidence indicates that biomass-specific production and growth rates are similar in both small and large cells but peak at intermediate cell sizes. The maximum nutrient uptake rate scales isometrically with cell volume and superisometrically with the minimum nutrient quota. The unimodal size scaling of phytoplankton growth arises from ataxonomic, size-dependent trade-off processes related to nutrient requirement, acquisition, and use. The superior ability of intermediate-size cells to exploit high nutrient concentrations explains their biomass dominance during blooms. Biogeographic patterns in phytoplankton size structure and growth rate are independent of temperature and driven mainly by changes in resource supply.},

abstract = {The increased use of hydropower is currently driving the greatest surge in global dam construction since the mid-20th century, meaning that most major rivers on Earth are now dammed. Dams impede the flow of essential nutrients, including carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and silicon, along river networks, leading to enhanced nutrient transformation and elimination. Increased nutrient retention via sedimentation or gaseous elimination in dammed reservoirs influences downstream terrestrial and coastal environments. Reservoirs can also become hotspots for greenhouse gas emission, potentially impacting how ‘green' hydropower is compared with fossil-fuel burning. In this Review, we discuss how damming changes nutrient biogeochemistry along river networks, as well as its broader environmental consequences. The influences of construction and management practices on nutrient elimination, the emission of greenhouse gases and potential remobilization of legacy nutrients are also examined. We further consider how regulating hydraulic residence time and environmental flows (or e-flows) can be used in planning and operation from dam conception to deconstruction. River damming can harness hydropower, control flooding and store water, but can also alter biogeochemistry in reservoirs and downstream environments. In this Review, the impacts of dams on nutrient cycling and greenhouse production are discussed, emphasizing the need to consider biogeochemical cycling at all stages of dam lifespan.},

abstract = {A new, in situ sensing system, Channelized Optical System (CHANOS), was recently developed to make high-resolution, simultaneous measurements of total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pH in seawater. Measurements made by this single, compact sensor can fully characterize the marine carbonate system. The system has a modular design to accommodate two independent, but similar measurement channels for DIC and pH. Both are based on spectrophotometric detection of hydrogen ion concentrations. The pH channel uses a flow-through, sample-indicator mixing design to achieve near instantaneous measurements. The DIC channel adapts a recently developed spectrophotometric method to achieve flow-through CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} equilibration between an acidified sample and an indicator solution with a response time of only ∼90 s. During laboratory and in situ testing, CHANOS achieved a precision of ±0.0010 and ±2.5 $\mu$mol kg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for pH and DIC, respectively. In situ comparison tests indicated that the accuracies of the pH and DIC channels over a three-week time-series deployment were ±0.0024 and ±4.1 $\mu$mol kg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, respectively.

Depletion rates, represented as areal hypolimnetic oxygen deficits (AHOD, g m-2 d-1), are calculated on the basis of weekly DO profiles of 1-m resolution and estimates of coincident inputs of DO from overlying layers driven by vertical mixing. Vertical mixing inputs of DO are important in this system, representing from 15{\%} to 37{\%} (mean 25{\%}) of AHOD. Interannual variations in hypolimnetic temperatures have comparatively minor (±6{\%}) effects on AHOD. AHOD decreased 49{\%}, from an average of 2.12 g m-2 d-1 for the 1978-1986 interval, to an average of 1.08 g m-2 d-1 for the 1997-2002 interval. This decrease was driven by an abrupt decrease in the deposition of particulate organic carbon into the hypolimnion starting in 1987. The magnitude of the decrease in AHOD closes reasonably well with decreases in both primary production in the trophogenic zone and organic carbon deposition to the tropholytic zone. The time course of the decrease in AHOD is consistent with localization of oxygen-demanding processes within the lake sediments, reflecting the progression of sediment diagenesis. {\textcopyright} 2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {This study aims at investigating decomposition processes in wetlands that are daily or seasonally exposed to intermittent oxic and anoxic conditions. We hypothesized that in wetland ecosystems where anoxia regularly establishes, decomposition rates are not affected by oxygen shortage, especially when nitrates are available. Monitoring and experiments were performed from December 2003 to January 2005 in one of the widest (81 ha) freshwater wetlands in the Po river floodplain (Natural Reserve Paludi del Busatello, Italy). Intact sediment cores were sampled on a seasonal basis. Sediment–water fluxes of oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon, methane, and inorganic nitrogen were determined under oxic and anoxic conditions. Oxic–anoxic transitions always resulted in enhanced ammonium, dissolved inorganic carbon, and methane effluxes. At high temperatures, the methane release from sediments was inversely related to both nitrate concentrations and uptake. Likely, nitrate can compensate for the oxygen deficiency while maintaining an oxidative metabolism, either supporting microbial decomposition as an electron acceptor or stimulating the oxidation of the byproducts of the anaerobic metabolism, e.g., methane. This is a key point as the number of temperate wetlands with concurrent nitrate pollution and oxygen shortage is increasing throughout the world.},

abstract = {We investigated the role of lake sediments as carbon (C) source and sink in the annual C budget of a small (0.07 km2) and shallow (mean depth, 3.4 m), humic lake in boreal Sweden. Organic carbon (OC) burial and mineralization in the sediments were quantified from 210Pb-dated sediment and laboratory sediment incubation experiments, respectively. Burial and mineralization rates were then upscaled to the entire basin and to one whole year using sediment thickness derived from sub-bottom profiling, basin morphometry, and water column monitoring data of temperature and oxygen concentration. Furthermore, catchment C import, open water metabolism, photochemical mineralization as well as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions to the atmosphere were quantified to relate sediment processes to other lake C fluxes. We found that on a whole-basin and annual scale, sediment OC mineralization was three times larger than OC burial, and contributed about 16{\%} to the annual CO2 emission. Other contributions to CO2 emission were water column metabolism (31{\%}), photochemical mineralization (6{\%}), and catchment imports via inlet streams and inflow of shallow groundwater (22{\%}). The remainder (25{\%}) could not be explained by our flux calculations, but was most likely attributed to an underestimation in groundwater inflow. We conclude that on an annual and whole-basin scale (1) sediment OC mineralization dominated over OC burial, (2) water column OC mineralization contributed more to lake CO2 emission than sediment OC mineralization, and (3) catchment import of C to the lake was greater than lake-internal C cycling.},

abstract = {Lakes are a large source of CO2. An analysis of chemical and physical data from 5,118 boreal lakes reveals that a majority emit CO2 originating primarily from terrestrial sources rather than CO2 produced within the lakes. Annual CO2 emissions from lakes and other inland waters into the atmosphere are estimated to almost entirely compensate the total annual carbon uptake by oceans1,2,3. CO2 supersaturation in lakes, which results in CO2 emissions, is frequently attributed to CO2 produced within the lake4,5,6,7,8. However, lateral inorganic carbon flux through watersheds can also be sizeable9,10,11. Here we calculated lake surface water CO2 concentrations and emissions using lake pH, alkalinity and temperature from a compilation of data from 5,118 boreal lakes12. Autumn surface water CO2 concentrations and CO2 emissions from the 5,118 lakes co-varied with lake internal autumn CO2 production. However, using a mass balance approach we found that CO2 emission in the majority of lakes was sustained by inorganic carbon loading from the catchment rather than by internal CO2 production. Small lakes with high dissolved organic carbon and phosphorus concentrations, shorter retention times and longer ice-free seasons had the highest CO2 concentrations. CO2 emissions from these small lakes was twice that of comparable lakes in colder regions, and similar to emissions from subtropical and tropical lakes. We conclude that changes in land use and climate that increase dissolved inorganic carbon may cause emission levels from boreal lakes to approach those of lakes in warmer regions.},

abstract = {We examined data on CO2 and related limnological and geographic information from a sample of 948 Florida freshwater lakes. The objectives for this study were (1) to determine the partial pressures of carbon dioxide ($\rho$CO2) in the surface waters of a large sample of Florida lakes, (2) to determine if several limnological or geographic factors are related to levels of $\rho$CO2 in Florida lakes, and (3) to estimate the net annual rate of loss of CO2 to the atmosphere from the freshwater lakes of Florida. The calculated $\rho$CO2 for the lakes in our sample range from 0 to 81,000 $\mu$atm, with a mean of 3,550 $\mu$atm, a median of 1,030 $\mu$atm, and a geometric mean of 1,270 $\mu$atm. About 87{\%} of the Florida lakes were supersaturated with CO2. There were statistically significant correlations between values for $\rho$CO2 and several water chemistry variables; however, the R 2 values were small and accounted for only a small portion of the variance. In general the $\rho$CO2 values were higher in the lakes with low alkalinities and low contents of dissolved salts. The best predictor of $\rho$CO2 is pH, with an R 2 of 0.82 for a polynomial relationship. The $\rho$CO2 values tend to decrease from northwest to southeast across the state of Florida, which corresponds to the gradients we found for pH, alkalinity, and specific conductance. The average areal rate of carbon emission from the Florida lakes was 328 g C m-2 y-1, and the total carbon loss for the lakes and ponds of Florida was 2.0 Tg y-1. This amounts to about 2{\%} of the total carbon emissions from all the lakes of the world as estimated by previous studies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {We investigated the effect of the stimulation of bacterial growth on Artemia performance in combination with a standard and with a low algal feeding regime. In both regimes, organic carbon (supplied as sucrose or soluble potato starch) and 15N labeled inorganic nitrogen (supplied as NaNO3) were used to stimulate bacterial growth in the Artemia cultures at C/N ratio 10 and 50. After a culture period of 15 days, significantly improved biomass production was obtained in all treatments with the low algae feeding regime, supplemented by carbohydrate addition. In addition, results of 15N accumulation and fatty acid analysis in Artemia indicated that Artemia utilized more bacteria in algae-limited conditions. Our study shows that bacteria can be used as a nutrient source for Artemia compensating for suboptimal algae supply. In Artemia pond cultures, carbohydrate addition may hence potentially be used to stimulate the conversion of nitrogen waste into heterotrophic bacterial biomass. This can be converted into protein-rich Artemia biomass, especially when algae are in sub-optimal supply. These findings open perspectives for alternative Artemia pond production protocols, in addition to the present management procedures that exclusively focus on phytoplankton blooms as nutrient source to sustain dense Artemia populations. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Despite the efforts to control, protect and improve freshwater resources, eutrophication is still one of the main causes for reservoir water quality deterioration. Low-quality raw water reaching water supply treatment plants (WTP) implies an increment of chemical reagents to meet safety requirements, which may also increase the potential of disinfection by-products formation. The objective of this paper was to study the relationship between raw water quality coming from a water supply reservoir and the use of reagents in the associated WTP, through a series of stepwise regression models, in order to develop a simple statistical tool to select the most adequate withdrawal depth for optimizing the treatment processes. The results showed that chlorides, ammonia and water color were the main subrogate parameters in the reservoir explaining the need of chlorine and ozone in the pre-treatment and alum sulphate consumption in the WTP. Therefore, by controlling the variation of these parameters in the water column it would be possible to select the most appropriate reservoir withdrawal depth for reducing costs and risk of by-products formation during treatment, making the most of the water purification service offered by the ecosystem.},

abstract = {Measurements of hourly, daily and annual rates of aquatic primary production in coastal lagoons are now numerous, but the mechanisms that regulate primary production are still difficult to assess. Short term dynamics in functioning and diversity in geomorphological configuration, hydrodynamics, nutrient supply, and autotrophic populations, as well as the usage of various methods in primary production measurements, are among some reasons. Mesotrophic to eutrophic choked lagoons with depths exceeding about two meters and light limitation at the bottom are commonly phytoplankton based. In shallower choked to restricted lagoons with high nutrient loading perennial macroalgae appear in succession with phytoplankton. Restricted to leaky lagoons harbor more macrophytes and species predominance is selected by a combination of depth, tidal flushing, and nutrient loading. Nutrient budgets for coastal lagoons are still lacking, but external inorganic nitrogen loading seems to supply 5-20{\%} and sediment release 5-30{\%} of primary production demand. Regenerated production is thus high and its largest fraction is maintained by nutrient recycling in the water column. In comparison to primary production yield, approximately 10-25{\%} of carbon is accumulated in lagoon sediments. Many tropical and sub-tropical lagoons particularly those with typical dry/wet seasons are marked by seasonal shifts between autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism Beholding exceptions, annual primary production ranges from 200 to 500 g Cm−2year−1, and is highest in tropical choked phytoplankton based lagoons and those governed by macrophytes. Global coastal lagoon primary production is estimated at 1011kg C year−1 and is similar to the contribution by upwelling areas and by a factor of four less than estuaries where primary production per unit area is similar to that in lagoons.},

However, the package is not restricted to the carbon cycle or the oceans: it calculates, converts, and visualizes information necessary to describe pH, related CO2 air-water exchange, as well as aquatic acid-base chemistry in general for marine, estuarine or freshwater systems. Due to the fact that it includes the relevant acid-base systems, it can also be applied to pore water systems and anoxic waters. AquaEnv is implemented in the open source programming language R, which allows for a flexible and versatile application: AquaEnv's functionality can be used stand-alone as well as seamlessly integrated into reactive-transport models in the R modelling environment. Additionally, AquaEnv provides a routine to simulate and investigate titrations of water samples with a strong acid or base, as well as a routine that allows for a determination of total alkalinity and total carbonate values from recorded titration curves using non-linear curve-fitting. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

A model that predicts UV effects on marine primary productivity using a biological weighting function (BWF) coupled to the photosynthesis–irradiance response (BWF/P-E model) has been implemented for two strains of the picoplanktonic cyanobacteria Synechococcus, WH7803 and WH8102, which were grown at two irradiances (77 and 174 $\mu$mol m−2 s−1 photosynthetically available radiation (PAR)) and two temperatures (20 and 26 °C). The model was fit using photosynthesis measured in a polychromatic incubator with 12 long-pass filter configurations with 50{\%} wavelength cutoffs ranging from 291 to 408 nm, giving an effective wavelength range of 280–400 nm. Examination of photosynthetic response vs. weighted exposure revealed that repair rate progressively increases at low exposure but reaches a maximum rate above a threshold exposure ("Emax"). Adding Emax as a parameter to the BWF/P-E model provided a significantly better fit to Synechococcus data than the existing "E" or "T" models. Sensitivity to UV inhibition varied with growth conditions for both strains, but this was mediated mainly by variations in Emax for WH8102 while both the BWF and Emax changed for WH7803. Higher growth temperature was associated with a considerable reduction in sensitivity, consistent with an important role of repair in regulating sensitivity to UV. Based on nominal water column conditions (noon, solstice, 23° latitude, "blue" water), the BWFEmax/P-E model estimates that UV + PAR exposure inhibits Synechococcus photosynthesis from 78 to 91{\%} at 1 m, and integrated productivity to 150 m 17–29{\%} relative to predicted rates in the absence of inhibition.},

abstract = {In this study we assess the suitability of a recently introduced analog-based Model Output Statistics (MOS) downscaling method (referred to as MOS-Analog) for climate change studies and compare the results with a quantile mapping bias correction method. To this aim, we focus on Spain and consider daily precipitation output from an ensemble of Regional Climate Models provided by the ENSEMBLES project. The reanalysis-driven Regional Climate Model (RCM) data provide the historical data (with day-today correspondence with observations induced by the forcing boundary conditions) to conduct the analog search of the control (20C3M) and future (A1B) global climate model (GCM)-driven RCM values. First, we show that the MOS-Analog method outperforms the raw RCM output in the control 20C3M scenario (period 1971-2000) for all considered regions and precipitation indices, although for the worst-performing models the method is less effective. Second, we show that the MOS-Analog method broadly preserves the original RCM climate change signal for different future periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, 2071-2100), except for those indices related to extreme precipitation. This could be explained by the limitation of the analog method to extrapolate unobserved precipitation records. These results suggest that the MOS-Analog is a spatially consistent alternative to standard bias correction methods, although the limitation for extreme values should be taken with caution in cases where this aspect is relevant for the problem.},

abstract = {The present review is focused on the mesoscale physical processes recognized in the Western Iberia Ecosystem, complementing earlier reviews dedicated to larger scales. Recent studies support the idea that the mesoscale processes, superimposed on the larger scale variability, are the major factor controlling the ecosystem functioning in the region. A complex structure of interleaved alongshore slope, shelf and coastal currents that interact with eddies, buoyant plumes, upwelling filaments and fronts, surface layer expressions of the subsurface circulation and internal waves is revealed by the latest research. All of these contribute in different ways to have an effect on the ecosystem. The supposedly less variable winter circulation also exhibits significant mesoscale activity, in the form of eddy shedding from the poleward slope current, intermittent upwelling events and transient nearshore poleward flows. The present incomplete knowledge of this complex system presents a number of challenges and questions that must be addressed if we are to arrive at a satisfactory understanding and predictive capability for the system as a whole.},

abstract = {Oceanic communities are sources or sinks ofCO2, depending on the balance between primary production and community respiration. The prediction of how global climate change will modify this metabolic balance of the oceans is limited by the lack of a com- prehensive underlying theory. Here, we show that the balance between production and respiration is profoundly affected by environmental temperature. We extend the general metabolic theory of ecology to the production and respiration of oceanic communities and show that ecosystem rates can be reliably scaled from theoretical knowledge of organism physiology and measure- ment of population abundance. Our theory predicts that the differential temperature-dependence of respiration and photosyn- thesis at the organism level determines the response of the metabolic balance of the epipelagic ocean to changes in ambient temperature, a prediction thatwesupport with empirical data over the global ocean. Furthermore, our model predicts that there will be a negative feedback of ocean communities to climate warming because they will capture less CO2 with a future increase in ocean temperature. This feedback of marine biota will further aggravate the anthropogenic effects on global warming. global},

abstract = {A new high-resolution spectrofluorimetric probe and an automatic water-quality monitoring station (AWQMS) have been used to record seasonal variations in the spatial distribution of three functional groups of phytoplankton in a Mediterranean water-supply reservoir. In comparison with classical methods, the combined use of these innovative techniques enables development of faster and less laborious spatial distribution surveys, thus favouring higher-frequency and spatially more detailed measurements, and, consequently, a better understanding of phytoplankton dynamics. The results show that the observed variations can be explained by the interaction between the buoyancy properties of the phytoplankton and the mixing characteristics of the reservoir. During the winter, when the lake was isothermal and the phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms, there was no significant spatial variation. In the spring, when the phytoplankton was dominated by chlorophytes there was also very little variation but some motile species formed patches when the wind speed was low. The most pronounced non-uniform distributions of phytoplankton were observed during the summer when the phytoplankton community was dominated by positively buoyant cyanobacteria. Then there was a very strong link between the vertical and horizontal gradients which were also related to the prevailing meteorological conditions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.},

abstract = {Vertical patterns of phytoplankton biomass driven by phytoflagellate migration constitute a natural, short-term process with potentially important impacts on estuarine primary production and community composition. Although often considered well-mixed, phytoflagellate vertical migration patterns have been observed in shallow estuaries. We investigated vertical migration patterns in two shallow estuaries to determine how often and under what environmental conditions vertical migration patterns occurred, and to understand the potential impacts of vertical migration on phytoplankton composition and productivity. Vertical migration patterns were determined from circumannual records of decimeter-scale, semihourly, vertical profiles of chlorophyll fluorescence in two shallow, microtidal estuaries, the New River Estuary and Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina, USA. Observed migration patterns were compared with coincident measures of temperature, salinity, light, turbidity, nutrients, vertical stratification, and wind speed. A simple light × biomass model was used to estimate the influence of vertical migration patterns on total water column primary production. Collectively, between two sites in each estuary, diel vertical migration (DVM) patterns were detected on about half of the days. A secondary migration pattern reflecting a midday descent was also observed and was attributed to avoidance of intense midday surface irradiance. The likelihood of detectable DVM patterns increased under warmer conditions and lower incident irradiance, and at two of the stations was lessened by elevated wind speeds or reduced stratification intensity. Even weak stratification may be sufficient to reduce vertical mixing to levels that allow effective depth regulation by directed swimming. Modeled depth-integrated primary production was increased modestly ({\textless}10{\%}) by observed migration patterns compared to a hypothetical vertically-homogenous biomass distribution. Access to optimal light levels and elevated bottom water dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations provides selective advantages that may explain phytoflagellate dominance in these estuaries, particularly during the warmer months, when production in surface waters of both systems is strongly N-limited.},

abstract = {One of the most important physical characteristics driving lifecycle events in lakes is stratification. Already subtle variations in the timing of stratification onset and break-up (phenology) are known to have major ecological effects, mainly by determining the availability of light, nutrients, carbon and oxygen to organisms. Despite its ecological importance, historic and future global changes in stratification phenology are unknown. Here, we used a lake-climate model ensemble and long-term observational data, to investigate changes in lake stratification phenology across the Northern Hemisphere from 1901 to 2099. Under the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario, stratification will begin 22.0 ± 7.0 days earlier and end 11.3 ± 4.7 days later by the end of this century. It is very likely that this 33.3 ± 11.7 day prolongation in stratification will accelerate lake deoxygenation with subsequent effects on nutrient mineralization and phosphorus release from lake sediments. Further misalignment of lifecycle events, with possible irreversible changes for lake ecosystems, is also likely.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton size structure is key for the ecology and biogeochemistry of pelagic ecosystems, but the relationship between cell size and maximum growth rate ($\mu$(max) ) is not yet well understood. We used cultures of 22 species of marine phytoplankton from five phyla, ranging from 0.1 to 10(6) $\mu$m(3) in cell volume (V(cell) ), to determine experimentally the size dependence of growth, metabolic rate, elemental stoichiometry and nutrient uptake. We show that both $\mu$(max) and carbon-specific photosynthesis peak at intermediate cell sizes. Maximum nitrogen uptake rate (V(maxN) ) scales isometrically with V(cell) , whereas nitrogen minimum quota scales as V(cell) (0.84) . Large cells thus possess high ability to take up nitrogen, relative to their requirements, and large storage capacity, but their growth is limited by the conversion of nutrients into biomass. Small species show similar volume-specific V(maxN) compared to their larger counterparts, but have higher nitrogen requirements. We suggest that the unimodal size scaling of phytoplankton growth arises from taxon-independent, size-related constraints in nutrient uptake, requirement and assimilation.},

@article{Einsele2001,
abstract = {Lake basins (∼ 2.7 × 106 km2, about 0.8{\%} of the ocean surface or 2{\%} of the land surface) bury a surprisingly high amount of atmospheric carbon (∼ 70 × 106 t/a) which reaches more than one fourth of the annual atmospheric carbon burial in the modern oceans. This is mainly accomplished by the rapid accumulation of lacustrine sediments and a very high preservation factor (on average 50 times higher than that in the oceans). Lakes with relatively large drainage areas commonly display the highest carbon accumulation rates. In most cases, burial of organic matter is more important than that of carbonate carbon produced by silicate weathering, in contrast to the oceans where the burial of atmospheric carbonate carbon almost reaches the same amount as that of organic carbon. Exceptions to this rule are closed lake basins in arid to semiarid climate which precipitate a major part of their atmosphere-derived dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as carbonate. These results are demonstrated in some detail for L. Qinghai, China, (low contribution of atmospheric carbonate carbon) and L. Turkana, East Africa, (high contribution from silicate rocks). Further data are gained by estimates for a number of closed and open lakes. The drainage areas of the lakes withdraw atmospheric carbon at rates of mostly 1-4 g/m2/a, calculated from the lacustrine carbon burial. Carbon burial rates in lakes commonly increase with change to wetter and warmer climate (partially larger lake surfaces, higher rates of seasonal carbonate precipitation, trend to stratified lake waters with oxygen-deficient bottom water). Anthropogenic influence mostly enhances the production and preservation of organic carbon in lake basins (often by a factor of 3-4). After the last glacial maximum, the joint action of the globally spreading vegetation, peat growth, and carbon burial in lakes would have been able to reduce the atmospheric carbon pool to one third to one half of its present amount within a time period of 1 ka. However, CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean has brought about an overall increase in the atmospheric CO2 during the Holocene. The contribution of lakes and artificial reservoirs in counteracting man-made CO2 emissions should not be neglected. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many inland waters exhibit complete or partial desiccation, or have vanished due to global change, exposing sediments to the atmosphere. Yet, data on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from these sediments are too scarce to upscale emissions for global estimates or to understand their fundamental drivers. Here, we present the results of a global survey covering 196 dry inland waters across diverse ecosystem types and climate zones. We show that their CO2 emissions share fundamental drivers and constitute a substantial fraction of the carbon cycled by inland waters. CO2 emissions were consistent across ecosystem types and climate zones, with local characteristics explaining much of the variability. Accounting for such emissions increases global estimates of carbon emissions from inland waters by 6{\%} ({\~{}}0.12 Pg C y−1). Our results indicate that emissions from dry inland waters represent a significant and likely increasing component of the inland waters carbon cycle. Many inland waters seasonally or permanently dry up, thus exposing sediments to the atmosphere. Here the authors show that a substantial amount of CO2 is emitted from these dry sediments, increasing current inland water carbon flux estimates by 6{\%}.},

abstract = {Numerical models typically predict phytoplankton production by calculating an exponential response to water temperature to set maximum rates that are reduced by light and nutrient limitation factors. Formulations based on biomass, irradiance, and photic depth (the " BZI" model) have been suggested as an alternative. Both approaches are rooted in empirical observations even as they include parameters that are variables in equations of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). Application of the MTE to phytoplankton is particularly appropriate as these communities span several orders of magnitude in individual size. We present a dimensional analysis of the BZI model that demonstrates its first principles origin. Data from estuaries where the BZI model is applied are used to explore temperature dependency of productivity as formulated by the Boltzman factor used in the MTE. We demonstrate how theory and empirical studies may be combined to provide added insight to the application of predictive models. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

Its best-known manifestations are toxic cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and waterways and proliferations of green macro algae in coastal areas. The term eutrophication is used by both the scientific community and public policy-makers, and therefore has a myriad of definitions. The introduction by the public authorities of regulations to limit eutrophication is a source of tension and debate on the activities identified as contributing or having contributed decisively to these phenomena. Debates on the identification of the driving factors and risk levels of eutrophication, seeking to guide public policies, have led the ministries in charge of the environment and agriculture to ask for a joint scientific appraisal to be conducted on the subject. Four French research institutes were mandated to produce a critical scientific analysis on the latest knowledge of the causes, mechanisms, consequences and predictability of eutrophication phenomena. This paper provides the methodology and the main findings of this two years exercise involving 40 scientific experts.},

abstract = {Despite the recognized importance of reservoirs and dams, global datasets describing their characteristics and geographical distribution are largely incomplete. To enable advanced assessments of the role and effects of dams within the global river network and to support strategies for mitigating ecohydrological and socioeconomic costs, we introduce here the spatially explicit and hydrologically linked Global Reservoir and Dam database (GRanD). As of early 2011, GRanD contains information regarding 6862 dams and their associated reservoirs, with a total storage capacity of 6197 km 3. On the basis of these records, we estimate that about 16.7 million reservoirs larger than 0.01 ha - with a combined storage capacity of approximately 8070 km 3 - may exist worldwide, increasing Earth's terrestrial surface water area by more than 305 000 km 2. We find that 575 900 river kilometers, or 7.6{\%} of the world's rivers with average flows above 1 cubic meter per second (m 3 s -1), are affected by a cumulative upstream reservoir capacity that exceeds 2{\%} of their annual flow; the impact is highest for large rivers with average flows above 1000 m 3 s -1, of which 46.7{\%} are affected. Finally, a sensitivity analysis suggests that smaller reservoirs have substantial impacts on the spatial extent of flow alterations despite their minor role in total reservoir capacity. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Fine sediment in streams and rivers is one of the most globally widespread of all freshwater pollutants. However, the ecological implications are still poorly quantified, and field experiments to assess likely functional and structural effects are scarce. We assessed the response of stream invertebrates to fine sediment (i.e. inert sand) added to trays (n=65) containing otherwise natural substrata over a three-week period in three replicate streams in the Usk catchment, Wales. Sediment addition to 0.6-18kgm-2 affected both the structure and functional composition of invertebrate assemblages while also reducing overall abundance and in some common species (Baetis rhodani, Ecdyonurus sp. and Leuctra geniculata). Sediment also reduced richness and overall trait diversity (TD), while different life-history traits were either favoured (polivoltinism, tegumental respiration and burrowing behaviour) or disfavoured (swimmers, attached taxa, gill respiration). Moreover, sediments appeared to promote a nested subset pattern in species composition, with generalists favoured at the expense of specialists either through exclusion or impaired colonization. Effects were due largely to the loss of five taxa that contributed to the significant nestedness across the sand gradient: B. rhodani, Ecdyonurus sp., Leuctra geniculata, Simuliidae and Ephemerella ignita. This short-term experiment supports recent surveys in indicating how sedimentation can change the structural and functional composition of stream invertebrate assemblages even at low to moderate rates of deposition. In revealing direct effects on trait adversity, trait representation and nestedness, the data are also consistent with survey data in indicating that sediments have potentially important ramifications for conservation by removing organisms systematically according to life-history features. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The differential impact of microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis on the mineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC) in warm monomictic Lake Kinneret (LK), Israel was studied during three consecutive lake cycles. The hypolimnetic accumulation of total sulfide and dissolved methane was examined in relation to the physical forcing of the water column and the settling flux of particulate matter. With the on-set of thermal stratification in spring, both solutes increased concomitantly with the depletion of oxygen, first in the benthic boundary layer, followed by the upper hypolimnion. Methane production was restricted to the sediments as emphasized by the persistently linear concentration gradient in the hypolimnion. Sulfate reduction occurred both in the sediments and the water column as revealed by the hypolimnetic distribution of sulfide and recurring metalimnetic sulfide peaks. Annual differences in the accumulation pattern of both solutes appeared to be primarily linked to the settling flux of POC and the length of the stratified season. Relatively lower hypolimnetic concentrations of dissolved methane during the stratified season of 2000 coincided with increased ebullition of gaseous methane, likely as the result of a nearly a 2 m drop in the lake level. Overall, sulfate reduction accounted for more than 60{\%} of the POC settling flux, a finding that differs from similar studies made in temperate lakes where methanogenesis was shown to be the primary mode of terminal carbon mineralization. Intensive organic carbon turnover at the sediment water interface and comparatively high sulfate concentrations in LK are the most likely reason. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The standard for measuring solar irradiance utilizes the units of watts per meter squared (W/m2). Irradiance meters are both costly and limited in the ability to measure low irradiance values. With a lower cost and higher sensitivity in low light conditions, light meters measure luminous flux per unit area (illuminance) utilizing the units of lumens per meter squared or lux (lx). An effective conversion factor between W/m2 and lx would enable the use of light meters to evaluate photovoltaic performance under low solar irradiance conditions. A survey of the literature found no definitive and readily available “rule of thumb” conversion standard between solar irradiance and illuminance. Easy-to-find Internet sources contain conflicting and widely varying values ranging from 688449 to 21000 lx for 1000 W/m2 (1 Sun) of solar irradiance. Peer-reviewed literature contains Luminous Efficacy equivalent values ranging from 21 to 131 lx per W/m2. This manuscript explores the relationship and establishes a theoretical and laboratory measurement guide for the conversion between solar irradiance and illuminance. The conversion factor includes standards data, equipment calibration accuracy, and uncertainty estimates. Solar Irradiance of 1 Sun (1000 W/m2) for an LED-based solar simulator is (116 ± 3) klx and (122 ± 1) klx for outdoor sunlight.},

abstract = {We used a comparative data set for 25 lakes in Denmark sampled during summer to explore the influence of lake morphometry, catchment conditions, light availability and nutrient input on lake metabolism. We found that (1) gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (R) decline with lake area, water depth and drainage ratio, and increase with algal biomass (Chl), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP); (2) all lakes, especially small with less incident light, and forest lakes with high DOC, have negative net ecosystem production (NEP {\textless} 0); (3) daily variability of GPP decreases with lake area and water depth as a consequence of lower input of nutrients and organic matter per unit water volume; (4) the influence of benthic processes on free water metabolic measures declines with increasing lake size; and (5) with increasing lake size, lake metabolism decreases significantly per unit water volume, while depth integrated areal rates remain more constant due to a combination of increased light and nutrient limitation. Overall, these meta-parameters have as many significant but usually weaker relationships to whole-lake and benthic metabolism as have TP, Chl and DOC that are directly linked to photosynthesis and respiration. Combining water depth and Chl to predict GPP, and water depth and DOC to predict R, lead to stronger multiple regression models accounting for 57–63{\%} of the variability of metabolism among the 25 lakes. It is therefore important to consider differences in lake morphometry and catchment conditions when comparing metabolic responses of lakes to human impacts.},

@article{Halbedel2013,
abstract = {It has become more and more evident that CO2 emission (FCO 2) from freshwater systems is an important part of the global carbon cycle. To date, only a few studies have addressed the different mechanisms that regulate FCO2 in lotic and lentic systems. In a comparative study we investigated how different biogeochemical and physical factors can affect FCO2 values in streams and reservoirs. We examined the seasonal variability in CO2 concentrations and emissions from four streams and two pre-dams of a large drinking water reservoir located in the same catchment, and compared them with environmental factors that were measured concurrently. All the streams were generally supersaturated with CO2 throughout the year, while both reservoirs functioned to a small degree as CO2 sinks during summer stratification and CO2 sources after circulation had set in. FCO2 from streams ranged from 23 to 355 mmol m-2 d-1 and exceeded the fluxes recorded for the reservoirs (-8.9 to 161.1 mmol m-2 d-1). Both the generally high piston velocity (k) and the CO2 oversaturation contributed to the higher FCO2 from streams in comparison to lakes. In both streams and reservoirs FCO2 was mainly governed by the CO2 concentration (r Combining double low line 0.92, p {\textless} 0.001 for dams; r Combining double low line 0.90, p {\textless} 0.001 for streams), which was in turn affected by metabolic processes and nutrients in both systems and also by lateral inflow in the streams. Besides CO2 concentration, physical factors also influence FCO2 in lakes and streams. During stratification, FCO2 in both pre-dams was regulated by primary production in the epilimnion, which led to a decrease of FCO 2. During circulation, when CO2 from the hypolimnion was mixed with the epilimnion, FCO2 increased on account of the CO 2 input from the hypolimnion. The CO2 from the hypolimnion originates from the mineralisation of organic matter. FCO2 from streams was mainly influenced by geomorphological and hydrological factors affecting k, which is less relevant in low-wind lakes. Under high-wind conditions, however, k regulates FCO2 from lotic systems as well. We developed a theoretical framework describing the role of the different regulation mechanisms for FCO2 from streams and lakes. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} In summary, the dominant factor affecting FCO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the surface water. Lake stratification has a very important regulatory effect on FCO2 from lakes on account of its influence on CO2 concentrations and metabolic processes. Nevertheless, FCO2 values in heterotrophic streams are generally higher. The higher k values are responsible for the comparatively high degree of FCO2. On a Central European scale, CO2 emission from streams is probably of greater importance than the CO2 flux from standing waters. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013. CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

abstract = {Seasonal climate forecasts produce probabilistic predictions of meteorological variables for subsequent months. This provides a potential resource to predict the influence of seasonal climate anomalies on surface water balance in catchments and hydro-thermodynamics in related water bodies (e.g., lakes or reservoirs). Obtaining seasonal forecasts for impact variables (e.g., discharge and water temperature) requires a link between seasonal climate forecasts and impact models simulating hydrology and lake hydrodynamics and thermal regimes. However, this link remains challenging for stakeholders and the water scientific community, mainly due to the probabilistic nature of these predictions. In this paper, we introduce a feasible, robust, and open-source workflow integrating seasonal climate forecasts with hydrologic and lake models to generate seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature profiles. The workflow has been designed to be applicable to any catchment and associated lake or reservoir, and is optimized in this study for four catchment-lake systems to help in their proactive management. We assessed the performance of the resulting seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature by comparing them with hydrologic and lake (pseudo)observations (reanalysis). Precisely, we analysed the historical performance using a data sample of past forecasts and reanalysis to obtain information about the skill (performance or quality) of the seasonal forecast system to predict particular events. We used the current seasonal climate forecast system (SEAS5) and reanalysis (ERA5) of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We found that due to the limited predictability at seasonal time-scales over the locations of the four case studies (Europe and South of Australia), seasonal forecasts exhibited none to low performance (skill) for the atmospheric variables considered. Nevertheless, seasonal forecasts for discharge present some skill in all but one case study. Moreover, seasonal forecasts for water temperature had higher performance in natural lakes than in reservoirs, which means human water control is a relevant factor affecting predictability, and the performance increases with water depth in all four case studies. Further investigation into the skillful water temperature predictions should aim to identify the extent to which performance is a consequence of thermal inertia (i.e., lead-in conditions).},

The size analysis of algae into netplankton (≥64$\mu$m) and nannoplankton ({\textless}64$\mu$m) and its various size fractions ({\textless}5; 5-10; 10-20; 20-44; 44-64$\mu$m) was based on microscopic enumeration and measurements by means of the Uterm{\"{o}}hl procedure. Primary production experiments and their subsequent fractionation by means of Carbon-14 technique were undertaken to determine the relative photosynthetic rate of different size fractions of algae. Production /biomass quotients (activity coefficients) were computed and related to species composition. On a lakewide basis the nannoplankton was the major component of the algal biomass contributing from 57-80{\%} and comprised mainly of Cryptophyceae, Diatomeae, and Chrysophyceae. Nannoplankton were also abundant vertically. The most common nannoplankton were: Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus bijuga (Turp.) Lagerheim, Ochromonas spp., Chrysochromulina parva Lackey, Chrysocapsa sp., Chromulina elegans Doflein, Cyclotella comta (Ehr.) K{\"{u}}tz. C. ocellata Pant., C. bodanica Eulen., Asterionella formosa Hass., Rhodomonas minuta Skuja, R. minuta var. nannoplanctica Skuja, Cryptomonas erosa Ehr., C. marsonii Skuja, Katablepharis ovalis Skuja, and Gymnodinium spp. The nannoplankton also dominated the community metabolism by contributing, on an average, 87-94{\%} to the primary production as demonstrated by Carbon-14 fractionation experiments. The smallest size fraction of the uptake experiments ({\textless}10$\mu$m), consisting of $\mu$-algae and ultraplankton, was the most active fraction photosynthetically, contributing 72{\%} to the total production. The Lake Superior algae were rich in chlorophyll content and were relatively efficient when compared to the lower Great Lakes as indicated by high Production/Biomass (P/B) and chlorophyll/biomass ratios. The cryptomonad species like Rhodomonas minuta, Cryptomonas erosa, C. marsonii, and the diatom Asterionella formosa showed extremely high P/B quotients. These results emphasize the importance of adopting the Uterm{\"{o}}hl technique and a fractionation approach both in taxonomic and physiological research to focus on the complex nannoplankton ecology which clearly plays a key role in population dynamics.},

abstract = {The Gulf of Cadiz (North-eastern Atlantic, Spain) is an exploited ecosystem characterized by high marine biodiversity and productivity. Over the last decade, the landings of fish stocks such as anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and hake (Merluccius merluccius) have been declining and currently remain low. A food-web model of the Gulf of Cadiz has been developed by means of a mass balance approach using the software EwE 6 to provide a snapshot of the ecosystem in 2009. The goals of this study were to: (1) characterize the food-web structure and functioning, (2) identify the main keystone groups of the ecosystem, (3) assess the impact of fishing to the Gulf of Cadiz compared to that in other essential marine ecosystems in the coastal area of Spain: Cantabrian Sea (North-eastern Atlantic) and Southern Catalan Sea (Mediterranean Sea), and (4) examine the limitations and weaknesses of the Gulf of Cadiz model for improvements and future research directions. The model consists of 43 functional groups, including the main trophic components of the system with emphasis target and non-target fish species. The main trophic flows are determined by the interaction between detritus, phytoplankton and micro- and mesozooplankton. Rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris), cephalopods and dolphins present important overall effects as keystone species on the rest of the groups. The exploitation of fisheries composed mainly of trawlers, purse seiners and artisanal boats is intensive in the Gulf of Cadiz with all fleets exerting high impacts on most living groups of the ecosystem. The findings highlighted that the Gulf of Cadiz is a notably stressed ecosystem, displaying characteristics of a heavily exploited area. The comparative approach highlights that the three ecosystems display similarities with regard to structure and functioning such as the dominance of the pelagic fraction, a strong benthic-pelagic coupling, the important role of detritus, and the high impact of fishery exploitation.},

abstract = {We compared the burial efficiency of organic carbon (buried OC: deposited OC) in a diverse set of 27 different sediments from 11 lakes, focusing on the potential effects of organic matter source, oxygen exposure, and protective sorption of OC onto mineral surfaces. Average OC burial efficiency was high (mean 48{\%}), and it was particularly high in sediments receiving high input of allochthonous organic matter (mean 67{\%}). Further, OC burial efficiency was strongly negatively related to the oxygen exposure time, again particularly so in sediments receiving high allochthonous loads. On the other hand, OC burial efficiency was not related to the mineral surface area, which was used as a proxy of the sorption capacity of the mineral phase for OC. The high OC burial efficiency in many lake sediments can thus be attributed to the frequent and significant input of allochthonous organic matter to lakes, as well as to a strong dependence of OC burial efficiency on oxygen exposure time. This study demonstrates that the carbon sink in lake sediments alters the OC export from the continents to the sea and that the fate of OC in lake sediments (burial vs. mineralization to carbon dioxide and methane) is highly sensitive to environmental conditions.},

abstract = {We present evidence that land use practices in the plains of Colorado influence regional climate and vegetation in adjacent natural areas in the Rocky Mountains in predictable ways. Mesoscale climate model simulations using the Colorado State University Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (RAMS) projected that modifications to natural vegetation in the plains, primarily due to agriculture and urbanization, could produce lower summer temperatures in the mountains. We corroborate the RAMS simulations with three independent sets of data: (i) climate records from 16 weather stations, which showed significant trends of decreasing July temperatures in recent decades; (ii) the distribution of seedlings of five dominant conifer species in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, which suggested that cooler, wetter conditions occurred over roughly the same time period; and (iii) increased stream flow, normalized for changes in precipitation, during the summer months in four river basins, which also indicates cooler summer temperatures and lower transpiration at landscape scales. Combined, the mesoscale atmospheric/land-surface model, short-term trends in regional temperatures, forest distribution changes, and hydrology data indicate that the effects of land use practices on regional climate may overshadow larger-scale temperature changes commonly associated with observed increases in CO2 and other greenhouse gases.},

abstract = {We tested if the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) correctly predicts plankton metabolism in a temperate lake, based on a long-term (about 15 years), high-frequency dataset of body size, abundance and production, using two different techniques: least squares regression and maximum likelihood. For phytoplankton, the general fit was relatively poor (r2? 0.53). The assumption of the MTE on temperature dependence of metabolism was not supported, and the assumed value of 3⁄4 of the allometric exponent was barely within 95{\%} confidence limits. For some of the models, the value of b was significantly higher than 3⁄4. When radiation was included as an additional predictor, it improved the model considerably (r2?0.67). Including grazing by zooplankton reduced the model residuals during the summer period, when grazing is a dominant factor. The allometric exponent had virtually no effect for phytoplankton, due to little variability in average individual size. Zooplankton production, on the other hand, was better predicted by MTE, showing stronger effects of temperature and body size, the average of which varied by a factor of more than a hundred. However, the best-fitting value of the allometric exponent for zooplankton was 0.85, and significantly higher than the 3⁄4 predicted by the theory. The ratio of observed production to biomass for the entire plankton community declined linearly with the body size (in log-log) with a slope corresponding to a value of b?0.85. We conclude that the MTE has little predictive power for the metabolism of lacustrine plankton, in particular for phytoplankton, and especially at the scale of variability of this study, and that this could be improved by incorporating radiation into the model.},

abstract = {We analyzed the effect of ambient levels of visible and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on picophytoplankton cell death by exposing natural communities of picophytoplankton (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and picoeukaryotic cells) from the Atlantic Ocean to different levels of natural solar radiation, from that received just below the surface to 23{\%} lower levels and dark conditions. Underwater oceanic levels of UVR and visible light can induce significant cell death in picophytoplankton communities. The decay rates of living cells induced by solar radiation was highest for Prochlorococcus sp., which showed an average decay rate of -0.24 ± 0.053 h-1 (mean ± SE) in the experiments, whereas Synechococcus sp. showed the lowest decay rate of -0.021 ± 0.008 h-1 (mean ± SE) in treatments ranging from the full incident irradiance to 23{\%} of the irradiance incident below the ocean surface. Decay rates decreased significantly upon removal of UVR, demonstrating a major effect of UVR on cell death, although ambient levels of visible light alone still induced cell death in Prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotic populations, but not in Synechococcus sp. The high cell death of Prochlorococcus induced by total solar radiation resulted in short half-life values for this genus, ranging between 1.5 and 13.4 h across treatments. The half-life times for Synechococcus sp. and eukaryotic picoplankton cells exposed to UVR were longer, varying from 8.8 to 14.7 h and from 2.1 to 31.7 h, respectively. The UVR doses required to reduce the picophytoplankton populations by 50{\%} (LRD50) differed among the three groups, with considerably lower doses required for Prochlorococcus sp. Prochlorococcus sp. is highly sensitive to solar radiation, contrasting with the higher tolerance of Synechococcus sp. High, but taxon-specific, phytoplankton mortality induced by ambient UVR levels may act as a primary driver of the community structure of autotrophs and affect the dynamics of the microbial food web in clear, oligotrophic, oceanic waters. {\textcopyright} 2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

Samples were collected to determine the distribution of chl-a and cyanobacteria abundance and to analyse their coupling with thermohaline and chemical properties in the gulf region.

Maximum levels were recorded for the entire study region during winter due to winter mixing and the strong influence of the Guadalquivir River and Bay of C{\'{a}}diz outflow. Maximum chl-a levels were reached during spring for the entire region and for the entire water column. Minimum values of chl-a were observed during summer, under prevailing oligotrophic conditions, and winter when in spite of relatively high nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton growth was probably light-limited. The distribution of both cyanobacteria populations also varied seasonally in association with the oceanographic conditions. Prochlorococcus maximum cell abundance was observed at the sea surface during the four cruises, except in the northern region during summer.

@article{Legendre1996,
abstract = {This paper describes an approach to determine, using a small number of food-web or hydrodynamic variables, the partitioning of phytoplankton production among 3 carbon fluxes, i.e, remineralization within the euphotic zone, food-web transfer, and sinking to depth of organic particles. In order to do so, the flows of biogenic carbon in the marine pelagic environment are reduced to 5 broad pathways, which are ordered along a continuum of decreasing export relative to primary production. At one end of the continuum, ungrazed phytoplankton is exported to depth and, at the other, biogenic carbon is remineralized within the bacteria-microzooplankton loop. In the present paper, export of biogenic carbon from the euphotic zone includes food-web transfer of primary production and downward flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) into deep waters. A simple model and data from the literature lead to the conclusions that: (1) the export characteristics of pelagic ecosystems are largely determined by the size structure of primary production and the matching (or, conversely, segregation) between primary production and grazing and (2) total export from the euphotic zone is a function of the delivery of mechanical energy to the upper water column whereas the partitioning of total export between food-web transfer and sinking of POC is controlled by temporal variations in depth of the surface mixed layer. Food-web transfer is significant for marine resources and sinking of POC may contribute to the regulation of climate change (sequestration at depth of biogenic carbon).},

@article{Gorham1989a,
abstract = {Among the important physical characteristics of a lake are whether it stratifies seasonally, and if so, the depth to which wind-mixing is limited by the stratification. It is generally known that sufficiently shallow lakes tend to remain isothermal throughout the year and that the depth of the thermocline in stratified lakes correlates positively with the surface area of the lake. Observations from lakes in several different regions of the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere show that whether a lake stratifies depends on both the maximum depth and the surface area of the lake, whereas the depth of the thermocline depends primarily on the surface area. A modification of previously published scaling arguments provides a plausible theoretical basis for some of this behavior. These arguments account for additional shear-induced mixing associated with the fundamental internal seiche in small lakes and with near-inertial motion in big lakes. For lakes of cross-basin diameter less than 5,000 m (surface area less than 25 km2), an estimate of the depth of the thermocline, h, at the time of maximum heat content is given by: h≅2.0 ($\tau$ g$\Delta$$\rho$) 1/2L 1/2 where $\tau$ is the wind stress associated with late summer storms, $\Delta$p is the density contrast between epilimnion and hypolimnion typical for lakes in that region near the time of maximum heat content, g is the gravitational acceleration, and L is the square root of the surface area of the lake. A consistent set of units must be employed. {\textcopyright} 1989, International Association for Great Lakes Research. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society.The size spectrum of an ecological community characterizes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size. Size spectra are often used as ecosystem indicators of marine systems. They have been fitted to data from various sources, including groundfish trawl surveys, visual surveys of fish in kelp forests and coral reefs, sediment samples of benthic invertebrates and satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll. Over the past decades, several methods have been used to fit size spectra to data. We document eight such methods, demonstrating their commonalities and differences. Seven methods use linear regression (of which six require binning of data), while the eighth uses maximum likelihood estimation. We test the accuracy of the methods on simulated data. We demonstrate that estimated size-spectrum slopes are not always comparable between the seven regression-based methods because such methods are not estimating the same parameter. We find that four of the eight tested methods can sometimes give reasonably accurate estimates of the exponent of the individual size distribution (which is related to the slope of the size spectrum). However, sensitivity analyses find that maximum likelihood estimation is the only method that is consistently accurate, and the only one that yields reliable confidence intervals for the exponent. We therefore recommend the use of maximum likelihood estimation when fitting size spectra. To facilitate this, we provide documented R code for fitting and plotting results. This should provide consistency in future studies and improve the quality of any resulting advice to ecosystem managers. In particular, the calculation of reliable confidence intervals will allow proper consideration of uncertainty when making management decisions.},

abstract = {The Guadalhorce River mouth (M{\'{a}}laga, Southern Spain) was channelized between 1997 and 2003 to reduce flooding potential in adjacent densely populated sections of M{\'{a}}laga. The channel was bifurcated near the Mediterranean Sea, surrounding an isolated wetland complex composed of eight different ponds. Groundwater-level and wetland-stage data, combined with water-chemistry data from wells and wetlands, collected since 1977, have documented the hydrological and ecological responses to channelization. The results show that channelization has extended the tidal influence inland from the Mediterranean Sea through the Guadalhorce River and the subjacent coastal aquifers, producing a change in groundwater hydrodynamics. The isolation of the wetlands resulting from channelization has provoked a significant salinization of both surface water and groundwater, the extent of which varies among wetlands. These decadal-scale changes in water chemistry have promoted the appearance or increase of halophilic vegetation and have caused a shift from diving birds to predominantly shorebirds in some wetlands. Documentation of these unexpected ecosystem responses is a necessary first step for land managers who need to consider groundwater and surface water as a single resource, particularly in groundwater-dependent ecosystems along the densely populated and ecologically sensitive Mediterranean coastal areas.},

The key pathways modeled include diffusive and bubble release of CH4 from the sediment, aerobic CH4 oxidation, and atmospheric gas exchange. The temporal and spatial dynamics of dissolved CH4 concentrations observed in the lake during 3 years could be well represented by the combined models. Remarkably, the relative contributions of ebullition and diffusive transport to the accumulation of CH4 in the hypolimnion during the stratified period could not be accurately constrained based only on the observed evolution of CH4 concentrations in the water column. Importantly, however, our analysis showed that most (∼99{\%}) of the CH4 supplied to the water column by bubble dissolution and diffusive transport from the sediment is aerobically oxidized, whereas a substantial fraction (∼60{\%}) of the sediment-released bubble CH4 is directly transported to the atmosphere. Ebullition is thus responsible for the bulk of the emissions from Lake Kinneret to the atmosphere. Therefore, as in all freshwaters, ebullition quantification is crucial for accurately assessing CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. This task remains challenging due to high spatio-temporal variability, but combining in situ measurements with a process-based modeling can help to better constrain flux estimates.},

abstract = {Three approaches commonly used to quantify diffusive gas exchange across aquatic surfaces were compared in a densely treed, low-wind environment. Diffusive surface fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from a small boreal reservoir were estimated using (i) surface water concentrations, the thin boundary layer (TBL) equation, and gas transfer velocities (k) calculated using sulfur hexafluoride (SF6); (ii) surface water concentrations, the TBL equation, and k estimated from wind speed; and (iii) static floating chambers (FCs). Comparisonsweremadeduring three different ∼10-day intervals (August 2000, June and September 2001). CO2 and CH4 fluxes estimated from SF6- derived k were on average 1-3 times greater than those determined from wind-estimated k. Overall agreement between FC CO2 and CH4 flux estimates and those based on SF6 and wind speed derived kvalues was much weaker, with FC CO2 and CH4 flux estimates ranging from -9to 23 times those based on SF6 and wind-estimated k values. Chamber deployment likely enhanced gas transfer through disturbance of the surface boundary layer, and results of this study suggest that caution must be exercised concerning the use of FCs on very still water surfaces. Furthermore, findings of this study contradict the common belief that use of wind speed to approximate k is inappropriate for small bodies of water characterized by low winds and surface obstructions.},

abstract = {A freely available dataset produced from three million Landsat satellite images reveals substantial changes in the distribution of global surface water over the past 32 years and their causes, from climate change to human actions. The distribution of surface water has been mapped globally, and local-to-regional studies have tracked changes over time. But to date, there has been no global and methodologically consistent quantification of changes in surface water over time. Jean-Fran{\c{c}}ois Pekel and colleagues have analysed more than three million Landsat images to quantify month-to-month changes in surface water at a resolution of 30 metres and over a 32-year period. They find that surface waters have declined by almost 90,000 square kilometres—largely in the Middle East and Central Asia—but that surface waters equivalent to about twice that area have been created elsewhere. Drought, reservoir creation and water extraction appear to have driven most of the changes in surface water over the past decades. The location and persistence of surface water (inland and coastal) is both affected by climate and human activity1 and affects climate2,3, biological diversity4 and human wellbeing5,6. Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions7, statistical extrapolation of regional data8 and satellite imagery9,10,11,12, but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images13, we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change14 is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal15,16. Losses in Australia17 and the USA18 linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent, validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton and microphytobenthos are important components of estuarine ecosystems. In this review we discuss the factors known to influence the photosynthesis, primary production and biomass of these two groups of primary producers, and the application of new techniques. . There is a large interplay of variables influencing the rate ot phytoplankton photosynthesis (nutrient or light limitation, osmotic str{\~{}}ss) and factors {\~{}}n.nuencing biomass like grazing, washout, resuspensIOn and depositIOn. Phytoplankton in estuaries may experience rapid changes in the type of limitation (nutrients, light) and different physical environments (mixing, salinity), and these changes may int1uence species composition. Interannual variability in primary production can to a large extent be explained by changing weather conditions and changing land use, as the watershed and rainfall determine the nutrient and sediment input into estuaries. These inputs can both stimulate primary production when the system is nutrient limited or when the light conditions improve due to vertical density stratification, or it can decrease' primary production as sediment-laden water can decrease the light availability or flush out populations. There is a wealth of evidence that, due to increased land use and the concomitant increasing nutrient load, many estuaries have undergone eutrophication. The effect may to a large extent be dampened out when grazing by suspension feeders is important, as might have been the case in the Eastern Scheidt estuary, but other estuaries have shown signs that eutrophication might lead to the development of hannful algal blooms. Even in this case, total primary production will not necessarily change (in the case ?f turbid systems), but the changes in concentration and nutrient ratios might mfluence species composition, and it is important to realize that changes in the dominant species can have ecological implications. Thus, in order to understand ecosystem functioning better, we need to be able to understand what determines phytoplankton species composition and successio,n during blooms, what happens when blooms decay, how contaminants influence bloom dynamics and what is the interplay between nutrient enrichment and hannful algal blooms. These questions should preferably be addressed in integrated research programmes. . The relationship between iITadiance and photosynthesis of microphytobenthos is fairly well described, although more research is needed into the effects of microspatial distribution within the vertical profile, the degree of coupling between photosynthesis and population growth, and the different facets of nutrient limitation (in its broadest sense) on cell physiology. Realization that the species composition of a biofilm may be important, especially given that new techniques measure at a scale comparable with individual cells, requires that more than the (all too common) general description of a "diatom biofilm" should be attempted. Many questions remain about what factors control microphytobenthic biomass on muddy shores (resuspension, nutrients, grazing, exposure, desiccation, etc.), and whether predictive models can be generated. Such data are needed to permit accurate estimation of whole estuarine microphytobenthic primary production. Indeed, while only a few estimates of the contribution of microphytobenthos production to total estuarine production are available, statements about the importance of microphytobenthic activity in such systems are common. There is little evidence that microphytobenthic assemblages in cohesive sediments are nutrient limited, although carbon dioxide limitation of photosynthesis has been suggested. However, nutrient limitation can refer to either biomass accumulation or rates of processes, and within an estuary nutrient concentrations can co-vary with other factors that also influence microphytobenthos. Microphytobenthic biofilms may play an important role (or barrier) in the exchange of nutrients PHYTOPLANKTOANNDMICROPHYfOBENTHOS 95 between the sediments and the water phase, and in effecting bacterial processes. In low-nutrient systems, release of nutrients to the water phase from the sediment might be decreased by uptake of microphytobenthos, and this effect might be more pronounced when light is available when the sediments are submerged (i.e. in microtidal estuaries). Perhaps one of the obvious gaps in microphytobenthic data sets is the general scarcity of long-term data sets. With the increase in research on cohesive sediment microphytobenthos over the past 5 years, it can be hoped that longer-term data sets will become available. Such data may contribute to our ability to predict biomass and in detemuning the long-term response of microphytobenthic assemblages to eutrophication or improving water quality.},

abstract = {Zooplankton blooms are a frequent phenomenon in tropical systems. However, drivers of bloom formation and the contribution of emerging resting eggs are largely unexplored. We investigated the dynamics and the triggers of rotifer blooms in African soda-lakes and assessed their impact on other trophic levels. A meta-analysis of rotifer peak densities including abundances of up to 6 × 105 individuals L−1 demonstrated that rotifer bloom formation was uncoupled from the food environment and the seasonality of climatic conditions. A time series with weekly sampling intervals from Lake Nakuru (Kenya) revealed that intrinsic growth factors (food quality and the physicochemical environment) significantly affected rotifer population fluctuations, but were of minor importance for bloom formation. Instead, rotifer bloom formation was linked to sediment resuspension, a prerequisite for hatching of resting-eggs. Population growth rates exceed pelagic birth rates and simulations of rotifer dynamics confirmed the quantitative importance of rotifer emergence from the sediment egg-bank and signifying a decoupling of bloom formation from pelagic reproduction. Rotifer blooms led to a top-down control of small-sized algae and facilitated a switch to more grazing-resistant, filamentous cyanobacteria. This shift in phytoplankton composition cascaded up the food chain and triggered the return of filter-feeding flamingos. Calculations of consequent changes in the lake's energy budget and export of aquatic primary production to terrestrial ecosystems demonstrated the large potential impact of nonseasonal disturbances on the functioning of shallow tropical lakes.},

Here we approach this problem by focusing on body size, which is an easily measured species trait that has a pervasive influence on multiple aspects of community structure and ecosystem functioning. We test the predictions of a model derived from metabolic theory using data on ecosystem metabolism and community size structure. These data were collected as part of an aquatic mesocosm experiment that was designed to simulate future environmental warming. Our analyses demonstrate significant linkages between community size structure and ecosystem functioning, and the effects of warming on these links. Specifically, we show that carbon fluxes were significantly influenced by seasonal variation in temperature, and yielded activation energies remarkably similar to those predicted based on the temperature dependencies of individual-level photosynthesis and respiration. We also show that community size structure significantly influenced fluxes of ecosystem respiration and gross primary production, particularly at the annual time-scale. Assessing size structure and the factors that control it, both empirically and theoretically, therefore promises to aid in understanding links between individual organisms and biogeochemical cycles, and in predicting the responses of key ecosystem functions to future environmental change.},

abstract = {The Ria Formosa lagoon (south coast of Portugal) is a highly productive shallow mesotidal system of high water renewal through six permanent connections to the ocean. The three inlets in the western sector represent similar to 90{\%} of the total tidal prism. To understand spatial and temporal dynamics of nutrients, chlorophyll a (proxy of phytoplankton) and particulate matter, data acquisition of these parameters along with current velocity was conducted hourly during two consecutive semi-diurnal spring and neap tidal cycles (similar to 12.5 h) in the three inlets of Ria Formosa western sector, in late autumn of 2011. In all three inlets, nutrients ranges were typical for this time of the year, varying in antiphase relative to tidal signal, although less evident during the neap tide. Chlorophyll a and suspended solids concentrations were lower during the neap tidal cycle with less evident tidal variation than for nutrients. Net transport results show that Ria Formosa plays an important role in the mass export of nutrients to the adjacent coastal area, particularly during spring tides, with a greater contribution by the Faro-Olhao inlet, followed by the Armona and Ancao inlets. These two, regardless of the residual tidal prism, export nutrients while suspended solids were imported. The Faro-Olhao inlet presented different behaviour: it acts as a flood dominated inlet importing chlorophyll a and nitrate, and exporting ammonium and suspended solids. Nonetheless, values can change due to tidal variability, asymmetry and distortion, and interconnection of inlets inside the lagoon. To further understand the seasonal variation of this system more surveys will be conducted.},

abstract = {We measured sediment production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) and the net flux of CO2 across the surfaces of 15 boreal and subarctic lakes of different humic contents. Sediment respiration measurements were made in situ under ambient light conditions. The flux of CO2 between sediment and water varied between an uptake of 53 and an efflux of 182 mg C m-2 day-1 from the sediments. The mean respiration rate for sediments in contact with the upper mixed layer (SedR) was positively correlated to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the water (r 2 = 0.61). The net flux of CO2 across the lake surface [net ecosystem exchange (NEE)] was also closely correlated to DOC concentration in the upper mixed layer (r 2 = 0.73). The respiration in the water column was generally 10-fold higher per unit lake area compared to sediment respiration. Lakes with DOC concentrations {\textless}5.6 mg L-1 had net consumption of CO2 in the sediments, which we ascribe to benthic primary production. Only lakes with very low DOC concentrations were net autotrophic ({\textless}2.6 mg L-1) due to the dominance of dissolved allochthonous organic carbon in the water as an energy source for aquatic organisms. In addition to previous findings of allochthonous organic matter as an important driver of heterotrophic metabolism in the water column of lakes, this study suggests that sediment metabolism is also highly dependent on allochthonous carbon sources. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

abstract = {The activities of infaunal macrobenthos have major influences on the types, rates and distributions of diagenetic reactions involving manganese in relatively carbon-rich deep-sea and nearshore sediments. In some non-sulphidic hemipelagic deposits of the eastern equatorial Pacific (Panama Basin) biogenic reworking drives internal cycles of manganese, which can apparently account for up to ca. 100{\%} of organic carbon oxidation and reduction of 0 2 supplied (diffusively) to the sea floor. Heterotrophic (carbon-based) manganese reduction is stimulated by simultaneous mixing of reactive organic matter and manganese oxide into suboxic-anoxic deposits. In sulphidic sediments, biogenic reworking must also enhance a lithotrophic pathway (sulphur-based) pathway of manganese reduction by promoting contact of manganese oxides and iron sulphides. Particle reworking dramatically alters the balance between aerobic and anaerobic decomposition pathways, promoting the utilization of 0 2 in the reoxidaton of reduced metabolites rather than direct oxidation of carbon. Irrigated burrows create microenvironments, which increase manganese reduction—oxidation and deplete Mn2+ from deeper pore waters. This may increase net Mn 2+ production rates by removal of metabolites and potential co-precipitants with Mn 2+ . The occurrence and geometry of manganese oxide encrusted biogenic structures imply specific adaptations of infauna to manganese based microbial activity in hemipelagic sediments like the Panama Basin.},

abstract = {Benthic fluxes of nutrients and dissolved nitrous oxide (N2O) were determined by ben- thic chamber incubations in 2 regions on the northeastern near-shore continental shelf of the Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz (depth range: 8 to 34 m), one off the Guadalquivir River mouth and the other in the Bay of C{\'{a}}diz and its neighboring shelf. In total, 25 in situ benthic chamber incubations were performed dur- ing June 2006, November 2006, and February 2007 to investigate the main factors controlling benthic nutrient recycling and its significance at the study site. Nutrient benthic fluxes (in m–2 d–1) varied between –0.9 and 1.0 mmol NO3 –, –0.3 and 0.3 mmol NO2 –, –1.2 and 3.5 mmol NH4 +, –0.04 and 0.22 mmol HPO4 2–, and 0.2 and 2.9 mmol Si(OH)4. Benthic fluxes of N2O, ranging from –1.2 to 10.4 µmol N-N2O m–2 d–1, accounted on average for {\textless}1{\%} of total inorganic nitrogen fluxes. The regeneration of NH4 + and Si(OH)4 was mainly influenced by organic carbon oxidation rates and bulk organic carbon in surface sediments, whereas HPO4 2– regeneration was mostly influenced by bottom water oxygen concentration and water depth. Denitrification was estimated to account for between 9 and 13{\%} of organic matter remineralization and for a loss of between 57 and 67{\%} of potentially recy- clable nitrogen. Overall, benthic remineralization was estimated to degrade about 47{\%} of overlying primary production, supplying about 15 and 12{\%} of the phytoplankton N and P requirements, respectively. This highlights the importance of benthic organic matter remineralization on the bio- geochemistry of the northeastern continental shelf of the Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz.},

abstract = {The paradoxical limitation pattern of phytoplankton, i.e. the increase in carbon biomass in response to increased nutrient loading without an increased community growth rate, was examined using marine enclosures with and without addition of nutrients. The phytoplankton carbon biomass, determined from particulate carbon, chlorophyll a, and incorporation of 14C into chlorophyll a, increased in enclosures added both nitrate and phosphate. Phytoplankton growth rates derived from primary production (uptake of 14C into particulate carbon) and from rates of incorporation of 14C into chlorophyll a and protein remained, however, unaltered after nutrient additions, indicating that increased cell volume induced by phytoplankton succession could be responsible for the increased biomass without changing the relative growth rate. Though, no major changes were detected in the phytoplankton species composition in any enclosures, the population mean cell volume increased in enclosures enriched with both nitrogen and phosphate when compared to the control enclosure. The increased mean cell volume could explain the enhanced carbon biomass and the unchanged specific growth rates.},

abstract = {Epipelic diatoms represented the dominant microphytobenthos on the intertidal mudflats of the Severn Estuary, south-western Britain. Algal biomass (measured as chlorophyll a concentration) varied over a seasonal cycle and was strongly correlated with sediment shear strength and critical shear stress and therefore with position on the shore. High levels of diatom biomass were positively correlated with the concentration of colloidal carbohydrate within the surface sediments. The critical shear strength for incipient erosion was significantly correlated with position on the shore (moisture content) and with both chlorophyll a and colloidal carbohydrate, the latter being the best biochemical predictor for the incipient erosion threshold. The range of stress required to cause incipient erosion varied from 1.0 to 8.0 N m-2, with the sediment increasing in resistance landwards. Two-way analysis of variance using both moisture content and colloidal carbohydrate as variables explained the stability of the sediment better than individual pair-wise comparisons. Treatment of an experimental transect with biocide uncoupled the relationship between position on the shore and diatom biomass. Treated sediments became compacted and shear strength increased. However, there was no associated increase in the critical erosion threshold as compared with the less compacted natural sediments and this may be explained by the stabilizing activity of the natural biotic assemblages on untreated sediments. This study emphasises the importance of in situ technology because of the complex coupling between physical and biological processes and the importance of episodic climatic events.},

abstract = {Many lakes exhibit seasonal stratification, during which they develop strong thermal and chemical gradients. An expansion of depth-integrated monitoring programs has provided insight into the importance of organic carbon processing that occurs below the upper mixed layer. However, the chemical and physical drivers of metabolism and metabolic coupling remain unresolved, especially in the metalimnion. In this depth zone, sharp gradients in key resources such as light and temperature co-occur with dynamic physical conditions that influence metabolic processes directly and simultaneously hamper the accurate tracing of biological activity. We evaluated the drivers of metalimnetic metabolism and its associated uncertainty across 10 stratified lakes in Europe and North America. We hypothesized that the metalimnion would contribute highly to whole-lake functioning in clear oligotrophic lakes, and that metabolic rates would be highly variable in unstable polymictic lakes. Depth-integrated rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were modelled from diel dissolved oxygen curves using a Bayesian approach. Metabolic estimates were more uncertain below the epilimnion, but uncertainty was not consistently related to lake morphology or mixing regime. Metalimnetic rates exhibited high day-to-day variability in all trophic states, with the metalimnetic contribution to daily whole-lake GPP and ER ranging from 0{\%} to 87{\%} and{\textless}1{\%} to 92{\%}, respectively. Nonetheless, the metalimnion of low-nutrient lakes contributed strongly to whole-lake metabolism on average, driven by a collinear combination of highlight, low surface-water phosphorous concentration and high metalimnetic volume. Consequently, a single-sensor approach does not necessarily reflect whole-ecosystem carbon dynamics in stratified lakes.},

abstract = { Globally, inland waters emit over 2 Pg of carbon per year as carbon dioxide, of which the majority originates from streams and rivers. Despite the global significance of fluvial carbon dioxide emissions, little is known about their diel dynamics. Here we present a large-scale assessment of day- and night-time carbon dioxide fluxes at the water-air interface across 34 European streams. We directly measured fluxes four times between October 2016 and July 2017 using drifting chambers. Median fluxes are 1.4 and 2.1 mmol m −2 h −1 at midday and midnight, respectively, with night fluxes exceeding those during the day by 39{\%}. We attribute diel carbon dioxide flux variability mainly to changes in the water partial pressure of carbon dioxide. However, no consistent drivers could be identified across sites. Our findings highlight widespread day-night changes in fluvial carbon dioxide fluxes and suggest that the time of day greatly influences measured carbon dioxide fluxes across European streams. },

abstract = {The understanding of marine microbial ecology and metabolism has been hampered by the paucity of sequenced reference genomes. To this end, we report the sequencing of 137 diverse marine isolates collected from around the world. We analysed these sequences, along with previously published marine prokaryotic genomes, in the context of marine metagenomic data, to gain insights into the ecology of the surface ocean prokaryotic picoplankton (0.1-3.0 mum size range). The results suggest that the sequenced genomes define two microbial groups: one composed of only a few taxa that are nearly always abundant in picoplanktonic communities, and the other consisting of many microbial taxa that are rarely abundant. The genomic content of the second group suggests that these microbes are capable of slow growth and survival in energy-limited environments, and rapid growth in energy-rich environments. By contrast, the abundant and cosmopolitan picoplanktonic prokaryotes for which there is genomic representation have smaller genomes, are probably capable of only slow growth and seem to be relatively unable to sense or rapidly acclimate to energy-rich conditions. Their genomic features also lead us to propose that one method used to avoid predation by viruses and/or bacterivores is by means of slow growth and the maintenance of low biomass.},

abstract = {The relationship between previously published values of "the intrinsic rate of natural increase" (rm) and body weight is studied. When organisms covering a wide range of body weights are compared, a correlation is found which can be described by the equation rm = a {\$}W{\^{}}{\{}n{\}}{\$} where rm is the intrinsic rate of natural increase per day and W is the average body weight in grams; a is a constant which takes three different values for unicellular organisms and heterotherm and homoiotherm animals respectively. The constant n has a value of about -0.275 for all three groups. This result is compared to the previously found relationship between the metabolic rate per unit weight and body size. It is shown that rm can be interpreted as the productivity of an exponentially growing population and thus must correlate with metabolic rate. The values of the constants a and n, however, show that for each of the three groups, unicellular organisms, heterotherms and homoiotherms the ratio of energy used for maintenance to that used for production increases with increasing body size and that the evolution from protozoa to metazoa and the evolution from heterotherm to homoiotherm animals in both cases resulted in not only an increased metabolic rate, as shown previously, but also in a decreased population growth efficiency. It is shown that the increase in reproductive potential of homoiotherms relative to that of heterotherms is due to a shorter prereproductive period in the former group. Previous estimates of rm for different species and comparisons between these values in relation to their ecology are discussed in context with the found "rm-body weight" relationship. Attempts to show that such comparisons will be more meaningful when body size is included in the considerations are made. It is suggested that the found relationship may represent the maximum values rm can take rather than average values for all species, since it is likely that the species used for laboratory population-studies are biased in favor of species with high reproductive potentials.},

abstract = {1. We present a model that yields ecosystem-level predictions of the flux, storage and turnover of carbon in three important pools (autotrophs, decomposers, labile soil C) based on the constraints of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate. 2. The model predicts a 10 000-fold increase in C turnover rates moving from tree- to phytoplankton-dominated ecosystems due to the size dependence of photosynthetic rates. 3. The model predicts a 16-fold increase in rates controlled by respiration (e.g. decomposition, turnover of labile soil C and microbial biomass) over the temperature range 0-30 degrees C due to the temperature dependence of ATP synthesis in respiratory complexes. 4. The model predicts only a fourfold increase in rates controlled by photosynthesis (e.g. net primary production, litter fall, fine root turnover) over the temperature range 0-30 degrees C due to the temperature dependence of Rubisco carboxylation in chloroplasts. 5. The difference between the temperature dependence of respiration and photosynthesis yields quantitative predictions for distinct phenomena that include acclimation of plant respiration, geographic gradients in labile C storage, and differences between the short- and long-term temperature dependence of whole-ecosystem CO2 flux. 6. These four sets of model predictions were tested using global compilations of data on C flux, storage and turnover in ecosystems. 7. Results support the hypothesis that the combined effects of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate impose important constraints on the global C cycle. The model thus provides a synthetic, mechanistic framework for linking global biogeochemical cycles to cellular-, individual- and community-level processes. F},

There were large temporal variations for CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} fluxes, ranging from - 1.7 to 131 mg CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} h{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, in the macrophyte-covered littoral zone. The highest CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emissions occurred during the period of the summer algal bloom. The amount of CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} flux from June to September accounted for about 50-90{\%} of the annual fluxes. CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} fluxes from the bare infralittoral zone (-0.2∼4.2 mg CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} h{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) were low and close to those in the pelagic zone.

Recent observations indicate that the CanC region as a whole has been experiencing a progressive warming and a decrease in productivity over the last decades. This overall trend is however not directly reflected in the fisheries of the region. Here we update recent results and previous reviews on the CanC, covering aspects from the physical environment to fish populations and fisheries on a range of time scales. We approach these topics, when possible, through a comparative exploration of the biogeographical characteristics of different sub-regions comprising this ecosystem. This review shows that variability in coastline configuration, shelf width, coastal upwelling, nutrient fertilization, productivity, or retentive vs. dispersive physical mechanisms, among other factors, may help explain sub-regional differences in fish distributions and abundances in the CanC. Nevertheless, the lack of systematic information on the regional variability of physical and biological processes hampers an integrated understanding of the relative contribution of natural vs. human-induced variability in the populations of at least small-pelagic fishes and their associated fisheries.},

abstract = {Increased periods of prolonged droughts followed by severe precipitation events are expected throughout South America due to climate change. Freshwater sediments are especially sensitive to these changing climate conditions. The increased oscillation of water levels in aquatic ecosystems causes enhanced cycles of sediment drying and rewetting. Here we experimentally evaluate the effects of induced drought followed by a rewetting event on the release of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), and trace elements (iron, manganese, and zinc) from the sediment of a tropical reservoir in southeastern Brazil. Furthermore, we used bulb onions (Allium cepa) to assess the potential cytogenotoxicity of the water overlying sediments after rewetting. We found peaks in CO2 and CH4 emissions when sediments first transitioned from wet to dry, with fluxes declining as sediments dried out. CO2 emissions peaked again upon rewetting, whereas CH4 emissions remained unaltered. Our experiment also revealed average increases by up to a factor of {\~{}}5000 in the release rates of nutrients and trace elements in water overlying sediments after rewetting. These increased release rates of potentially toxic compounds likely explain the lower replication of Allium cepa cells (up to 22{\%} reduction) exposed to water overlying sediments after rewetting. Our findings suggest that increased events of drought followed by rewetting may lead to a range of changes in freshwater ecosystems, including nutrient enrichment, increased toxicity following resuspension of contaminants, and higher emission of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.},

abstract = {In ecosystems both production per unit biomass and biomass per unit area are functions of the individual body size of the organisms. Comparison of the properties of body-size spectra based on these two functions leads to their interpretation in energetics terms as reflections of three underlying mechanisms: the metabolic energy requirements of individuals, their aggregate food consumption, and the consequent dependence of organism number density on body size. The mean level of biomass observed over the whole body-size-range reflects the energy levels in particular ecosystems, while the succession of domes within the biomass spectrum expresses the trophic organization. Different shapes of these domes in different ecosystems may reflect the specific character of the predator-prey interactions in them.},

Several patterns emerged: (1) nearly isometric size-scaling of phytoplankton carbon fixation rate was described for both open-ocean and coastal ecosystems (mean slope: 1.17 and 0.90, respectively), supporting the idea that biomass-specific photosynthesis rates are largely independent of cell size; (2) less steep values for the size-scaling of abundance (mean slope: -0.73) were found in the coastal ecosystem compared to the open ocean (mean slope: -1.15); (3) large phytoplankton used more photosynthetic energy than smaller cells in the coastal ecosystem, but a constant flow of energy along the size spectrum was found in the open ocean; and (4) phytoplankton biomass turnover rates were 1 order of magnitude higher in the coastal ecosystem than in the open ocean, implying physiological limitation of phytoplankton growth in the oligotrophic ocean. Bottom-up and top-down mechanisms and their interaction with nutrient supply dynamics were suggested as major factors determining the contrasting phytoplankton size abundance distributions observed in coastal and open-ocean waters.},

abstract = {The magnitude of diffusive carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission from man-made reservoirs is uncertain because the spatial variability generally is not well-represented. Here, we examine the spatial variability and its drivers for partial pressure, gas-exchange velocity (k), and diffusive flux of CO2 and CH4 in three tropical reservoirs using spatially resolved measurements of both gas concentrations and k. We observed high spatial variability in CO2 and CH4 concentrations and flux within all three reservoirs, with river inflow areas generally displaying elevated CH4 concentrations. Conversely, areas close to the dam are generally characterized by low concentrations and are therefore not likely to be representative for the whole system. A large share (44-83{\%}) of the within-reservoir variability of gas concentration was explained by dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll, water depth, and within-reservoir location. High spatial variability in k was observed, and kCH4 was persistently higher (on average, 2.5 times more) than k CO2. Not accounting for the within-reservoir variability in concentrations and k may lead to up to 80{\%} underestimation of whole-system diffusive emission of CO2 and CH4. Our findings provide valuable information on how to develop field-sampling strategies to reliably capture the spatial heterogeneity of diffusive carbon fluxes from reservoirs.},

abstract = {Hydroelectric reservoirs can release significant quantities of CO 2, but very few results are available from the tropics. The objective of the present study was to estimate the emission of CO2 from the Balbina hydroelectric reservoir in the central Brazilian Amazon. Diffusive and ebullitive emissions were estimated at regular intervals, both above and below the dam, using a combination of static chambers and submerged funnels. Gas releases immediately below the dam were calculated as the difference between gas flux at the entrance and the outflow of the hydroelectric turbines. An inundation model derived from a bathymetric map and daily stage readings was used for spatial and temporal interpolation of reservoir emissions. Annual emissions of CO2, upstream and downstream of Balbina dam for 2005, were estimated as 2450 and 81 Gg C, respectively, for a total annual flux of 2531 Gg C. Upstream emissions were predominantly diffusive with only 0.02 Gg C yr-1 resulting from ebullition. On average, 51{\%} of the downstream emission was released by degassing at the turbine outflow, and the remainder was lost by diffusion from the downstream river. The total annual greenhouse gas emission from Balbina dam, including the CO2 equivalent of previously estimated CH4 emissions, was 3 Tg C yr-1, equivalent to approximately 50{\%} of the CO2 emissions derived from the burning of fossil fuels in the Brazilian metropolis of S{\~{a}}o Paulo.

abstract = {The ocean's biological pump strips nutrients out of the surface waters and exports them into the thermocline and deep waters. If there were no return path of nutrients from deep waters, the biological pump would eventually deplete the surface waters and thermocline of nutrients; surface biological productivity would plummet. Here we make use of the combined distributions of silicic acid and nitrate to trace the main nutrient return path from deep waters by upwelling in the Southern Ocean and subsequent entrainment into subantarctic mode water. We show that the subantarctic mode water, which spreads throughout the entire Southern Hemisphere and North Atlantic Ocean, is the main source of nutrients for the thermocline. We also find that an additional return path exists in the northwest corner of the Pacific Ocean, where enhanced vertical mixing, perhaps driven by tides, brings abyssal nutrients to the surface and supplies them to the thermocline of the North Pacific. Our analysis has important implications for our understanding of large-scale controls on the nature and magnitude of low-latitude biological productivity and its sensitivity to climate change.},

abstract = {The development of low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the hypolimnion of drinking water reservoirs during thermal stratification can lead to the reduction of oxidized, insoluble iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) in sediments to soluble forms, which are then released into the water column. As metals degrade drinking water quality, robust measurements of metal fluxes under changing oxygen conditions are critical for optimizing water treatment. In this study, we conducted benthic flux chamber experiments in summer 2018 to directly quantify Fe and Mn fluxes at the sediment-water interface under different DO and redox conditions of a eutrophic drinking water reservoir with an oxygenation system (Falling Creek Reservoir, Vinton, VA, USA). Throughout the experiments, we monitored DO, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), water temperature, and pH in the chambers and compared the metal fluxes in the chambers with time-series of fluxes calculated using a hypolimnetic mass balance method. Our results showed that metal fluxes were highly variable during the monitoring period and were sensitive to redox conditions in the water column at the sediment-water interface. The time-series changes in fluxes and relationship to redox conditions are suggestive of “hot moments”, short time periods of intense biogeochemical cycling. Although the metal concentrations and fluxes are specific to this site, the approaches for examining relationships between metals, oxygen concentrations and overall redox conditions can be applied by water utilities to improve water quality management of Fe and Mn.},

abstract = {Estimating carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission rates from reservoirs is important for regional and national greenhouse gas inventories. A lack of methodologically consistent data sets for many parts of the world, including agriculturally intensive areas of the United States, poses a major challenge to the development of models for predicting emission rates. In this study, we used a systematic approach to measure CO2 and CH4 diffusive and ebullitive emission rates from 32 reservoirs distributed across an agricultural to forested land use gradient in the United States. We found that all reservoirs were a source of CH4 to the atmosphere, with ebullition being the dominant emission pathway in 75{\%} of the systems. Ebullition was a negligible emission pathway for CO2, and 65{\%} of sampled reservoirs were a net CO2 sink. Boosted regression trees (BRTs), a type of machine learning algorithm, identified reservoir morphology and watershed agricultural land use as important predictors of emission rates. We used the BRT to predict CH4 emission rates for reservoirs in the U.S. state of Ohio and estimate they are the fourth largest anthropogenic CH4 source in the state. Our work demonstrates that CH4 emission rates for reservoirs in our study region can be predicted from information in readily available national geodatabases. Expanded sampling campaigns could generate the data needed to train models for upscaling in other U.S. regions or nationally.},

abstract = {Reservoir sediments exposed to air due to water level fluctuations are strong sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The spatial variability of CO2 fluxes from these drawdown areas are still poorly understood. In a reservoir in southeastern Brazil, we investigated whether CO2 emissions from drawdown areas vary as a function of neighboring land cover types and assessed the magnitude of CO2 fluxes from drawdown areas in relation to nearby water surface. Exposed sediments near forestland (average = 2733 mg C m−2 day−1) emitted more CO2 than exposed sediments near grassland (average = 1261 mg C m−2 day−1), congruent with a difference in organic matter content between areas adjacent to forestland (average = 12.2{\%}) and grassland (average = 10.9{\%}). Moisture also had a significant effect on CO2 emission, with dry exposed sediments (average water content: 13.7{\%}) emitting on average 2.5 times more CO2 than wet exposed sediments (average water content: 23.5{\%}). We carried out a systematic comparison with data from the literature, which indicates that CO2 efflux from drawdown areas globally is about an order of magnitude higher than CO2 efflux from adjacent water surfaces, and within the range of CO2 efflux from terrestrial soils. Our findings suggest that emissions from exposed sediments may vary substantially in space, possibly related to organic matter supply from uphill vegetation, and that drawdown areas play a disproportionately important role in total reservoir CO2 emissions with respect to the area they cover.},

abstract = {We examined the response of pico-phytoplankton communities sampled at the equatorial, tropical and temperate Central Atlantic Ocean to subsurface underwater solar radiation in order to test the generality of the reported cell mortality for these populations when exposed to high ultra violet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically active radiation. The natural communities of pico-phytoplankton populations tested experienced high cell mortality when exposed to high solar radiation, despite inhabiting tropical waters. Synechococcus and eukaryotes were more resistant to solar radiation than Prochlorococcus. The decay rates of all pico-phytoplankton groups examined tended to be much higher when exposed to total solar radiation than when UVB-R was filtered out. We also show that even short exposures of 30 min to high solar radiation were able to induce cell mortality in Prochlorococcus. The variability in the decay rates of living Prochlorococcus cells were strongly related to the condition of the original population. However, Synechococcus decay rates were higher in populations from the tropical area, with eukaryotes sensitivity increasing with increasing the trophic degree. The data reported in this study and in the literature revealed contrasting capacities of Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and eukaryotes to survive under high solar radiation. Although the mechanisms involved are as yet unclear, their elucidation may help explain niche partitioning among these organisms in the ocean. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {We quantified the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate (AHM; total areal hypolimnetic oxygen depletion including the formation of reduced substances) in two formerly eutrophic lakes based on 20 yr of water-column data collected during oligotrophication. The upward diffusion of reduced substances originating from the decomposition of organic matter in the sediment was determined from pore-water profiles and related to the time of deposition. More than 80{\%} of AHM was due to degradation of organic matter in the water column (including sediment surface) and diffusion of reduced substances from sediment layers younger than 10 yr. Sediments older than 10 yr, including the eutrophic past, accounted for ∼ 15{\%} of AHM. This "old" contribution corresponds to a 20-43{\%} fraction of the total sediment-based AHM. The contribution from old sediment layers to AHM is expected to be even lower in lakes with deeper hypolimnia ({\textgreater} 12 m). In summary, oxygen consumption in stratified hypolimnia is controlled mainly by the present lake productivity.

abstract = {Alkalinity production in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of Canada, the U.S.A., Norway and Sweden is calculated from either strong acid titrations or budgets for base cations and strong acid anions, using mass-balance budgets. Where alkalinity budgets for lakes and their catchments are calculated in acid-vulnerable geological settings, in-lake processes often contribute more to lake alkalinity than yield from terrestrial catchments. Nitrate and sulfate removal, and Ca exchange with sediments are the predominant alkalinity generating mechanisms in lakes. Nitrate and sulfte removal rates increase as the concentrations of NO-3 and SO42- in lake water increase, so that in-lake acid neutralizing capacity increases as acid deposition increases. Both processes occur in sediments overlain by oxic waters, at rates which seem to be controlled primarily by diffusion. {\textcopyright} 1986 D. Reidel Publishing Company.},

abstract = {The Aral Sea in 1960 was a huge brackish water lake (4th in the world in surface area) lying amidst the deserts of Central Asia. The sea supported a major fishery and functioned as a key regional transportation route. Since 1960, the Aral has undergone rapid desiccation and salinization, overwhelmingly the result of unsustainable expansion of irrigation that dried up its two tributary rivers the Amu Darya and Syr Darya and severely damaged their deltas. The desiccation of the Aral Sea has had severe negative impacts, including, among others, the demise of commercial fishing, devastation of the floral and faunal biodiversity of the native ecosystems of the Syr and Amu deltas, and increased frequency and strength of salt/dust storms. However, efforts have been and are being made to partially restore the sea's hydrology along with its biodiversity, and economic value. The northern part of the Aral has been separated from the southern part by a dike and dam, leading to a level rise and lower salinity. This allowed native fishes to return from the rivers and revitalized the fishing industry. Partial preservation of the Western Basin of the southern Aral Sea may be possible, but these plans need much further environmental and economic analysis. This paper, mainly utilizing hydrologic and other data as input to spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel)-based hydrologic and salinity models, examines the current efforts to restore the Aral and looks at several future scenarios of the Sea. It also delineates the most important lessons of the Aral Sea's drying.},

abstract = {This paper summarises the results of an extensive field campaign which demonstrates that high sediment organic matter is the primary driver of methane ebullition in a sub-tropical, freshwater reservoir. Methane emissions from freshwater reservoirs represent an important global methane source. Whilst diffusive methane fluxes are commonly used for predicting total emissions, recent studies show that the under-reported ebullitive fluxes can vary by over three orders of magnitude within an individual system and have a greater relative contribution compared to diffusion. Key to predicting this variability in emission rates is to better understand the primary drivers of different emission pathways, and in particular ebullition. Zones of catchment derived organic material as well as elevated water column chlorophyll a concentration have been associated with increased rates of ebullition. Little Nerang Dam (LND), a subtropical freshwater reservoir in Queensland Australia, consistently experiences high rates of ebullition adjacent to major inflow arms that are both deposition zones of catchment organic material as well as areas with elevated water column chlorophyll a concentration. A year-long study of emission rates was undertaken on LND during which water column chlorophyll a concentration, bottom water temperature and sediment organic matter content were assessed for methane ebullition potential. This included a transect with high-spatial sampling (259 sites) from the dam wall to the ebullition zones to explore the relationship between water column chlorophyll a concentration, sediment organic matter content and methane ebullition. These results showed that ebullition was associated with the large forest litter deposits adjacent to major inflow sites where sediment organic matter content was significantly higher compared with the main body of the reservoir.},

abstract = {The Ria Formosa is a shallow and multi-inlet coastal lagoon system in southern Portugal, with six permanent connections to the Atlantic Ocean. The western sector of Ria Formosa comprises three of the main inlets, Ando, Faro-Olhao and Armona, which contribute similar to 90{\%} of the total tidal prism of the lagoon. Of those three inlets, Ando and Faro-Olhao supply the minimum and maximum contribution for these exchanges, respectively. Four field surveys were conducted at these two inlets during the upwelling season (from spring to autumn) to determine the influence of upwelling process upon the hydrographic characteristics in spring tidal conditions: i) spring 2009 (Ando inlet), ii) autumn 2011 (both inlets) and iii) spring 2012 (Faro-Olhao inlet). Water samples were collected hourly (at three levels), along complete semi-diurnal tidal cycles, to determine chlorophyll a (chl a) and nutrient concentrations. At the same time, the water velocity was measured along the cross section to estimate the tidal prism, nutrients and chl a transports. Ando inlet contributes a much lower volume to the total tidal prisms than Faro-Olhao inlet. The temporal data variability reveals that chl a and nutrient dynamics through these inlets depends not only on the tidal influence and characteristics of the boundary waters, but also on the intensity of the atmospheric and oceanic forcings acting on the adjacent coastal zone. During pulses of coastal upwelling events, more evident in spring season (mainly in April 2009 and May 2012), the two inlets imported chl a and phosphate. In contrast, in the absence of upwelling conditions, due to wind reversals and/or long periods of wind relaxation, both inlets exported nitrate and phosphate, fertilizing the coastal ocean. However, the Ria Formosa is a highly complex hydrodynamic system, and hydrographic temporal differences can be expected at different scales as a result of changes in: i) morphological configuration of the natural inlets, ii) interconnectivity of channels, and iii) the seasonal meteorological and oceanographic conditions.},

abstract = {Allometric scaling of body size versus growth rate and mortality has$\backslash$nbeen suggested to be a universal macroecological pattern, as described$\backslash$nby the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). However, whether such scaling$\backslash$ngenerally holds in natural assemblages remains debated. Here, we test$\backslash$nthe hypothesis that the size-specific growth rate and grazing mortality$\backslash$nscale with the body size with an exponent of -1/4 after temperature$\backslash$ncorrection, as MTE predicts. To do so, we couple a dilution experiment$\backslash$nwith the FlowCAM imaging system to obtain size-specific growth rates and$\backslash$ngrazing mortality of natural microphytoplankton assemblages in the East$\backslash$nChina Sea. This novel approach allows us to achieve highly resolved$\backslash$nsize-specific measurements that would be very difficult to obtain in$\backslash$ntraditional size-fractionated measurements using filters. Our results do$\backslash$nnot support the MTE prediction. On average, the size-specific growth$\backslash$nrates and grazing mortality scale almost isometrically with body size$\backslash$n(with scaling exponent similar to 0.1). However, this finding contains$\backslash$nhigh uncertainty, as the size-scaling exponent varies substantially$\backslash$namong assemblages. The fact that size-scaling exponent varies among$\backslash$nassemblages prompts us to further investigate how the variation of$\backslash$nsize-specific growth rate and grazing mortality can interact to$\backslash$ndetermine the microphytoplankton size structure, described by normalized$\backslash$nbiomass size spectrum (NBSS), among assemblages. We test whether the$\backslash$nvariation of microphytoplankton NBSS slopes is determined by (1)$\backslash$ndifferential grazing mortality of small versus large individuals, (2)$\backslash$ndifferential growth rate of small versus large individuals, or (3)$\backslash$ncombinations of these scenarios. Our results indicate that the ratio of$\backslash$nthe grazing mortality of the large size category to that of the small$\backslash$nsize category best explains the variation of NBSS slopes across$\backslash$nenvironments, suggesting that higher grazing mortality of large$\backslash$nmicrophytoplankton may release the small phytoplankton from grazing,$\backslash$nwhich in turn leads to a steeper NBSS slope. This study contributes to$\backslash$nunderstanding the relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down$\backslash$ncontrol in shaping microphytoplankton size structure.},

abstract = {There is growing concern in Europe about the possible rise in the severity and frequency of extreme drought events as a manifestation of climate change. In order to plan suitable adaptation strategies it is important for decision makers to know how drought conditions will develop at regional scales. This paper therefore addresses the issue of future developments in streamflow drought characteristics across Europe. Through offline coupling of a hydrological model with an ensemble of bias-corrected climate simulations (IPCC SRES A1B) and a water use scenario (Economy First), long-term (1961-2100) ensemble streamflow simulations are generated that account for changes in climate, and the uncertainty therein, and in water consumption. Using extreme value analysis we derive minimum flow and deficit indices and evaluate how the magnitude and severity of low-flow conditions may evolve throughout the 21st century. This analysis shows that streamflow droughts will become more severe and persistent in many parts of Europe due to climate change, except for northern and northeastern parts of Europe. In particular, southern regions will face strong reductions in low flows. Future water use will aggravate the situation by 10-30{\%} in southern Europe, whereas in some sub-regions in western, central and eastern Europe a climate-driven signal of reduced droughts may be reversed due to intensive water use. The multi-model ensemble projections of more frequent and severe streamflow droughts in the south and decreasing drought hazard in the north are highly significant, while the projected changes are more dissonant in a transition zone in between. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s) .},

abstract = {Wetlands, and especially their littoral zones, are considered to be CH4 emissions hotspots. The recent creation of reservoirs has caused a rapid increase in the area of the world's littoral zones. To investigate the effects of water depth and water level fluctuation on CH4 fluxes, and how these are coupled with vegetation and nutrients, we used static closed chamber and gas chromatography techniques to measure CH4 fluxes in the littoral zone of a large reservoir near Beijing, China, from November 2011 to October 2012. We found that CH4 flux decreased significantly along a transect from open water to dry land, from 3.1 mg m−2 h−1 at the deep water site to approximately 1.3 mg m−2 h−1 at the shallow water site, and less than 0.01 mg m−2 h−1 in the non-flooded area. Water level influenced CH4 flux by affecting soil properties including soil redox potential, soil carbon and nitrogen, and bulk density. The largest emission of all was from the seasonally flooded site after a flooding event (up to 21.1 mg m−2 h−1), which may have been caused by vegetation decomposition. Submerged sites had greater emissions, while the driest site had lower emissions. Immediately after the monthly measurements had been made, we removed the aboveground vegetation to enable an assessment of the gas transportation per unit of biomass. Removal of biomass decreased emissions by up to 53{\%}. These results indicated the dominant effect of water depth on CH4 flux through effects of soil conditions, plant species composition and distribution. This study suggests that temporally flooded wetlands, including littoral zones, contribute significantly to the global CH4 burden. However, the current challenge is to capture their spatial extent and temporal variation in the fluxes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Picophytoplankton (i.e. cyanobacteria and pico-eukaryotes) are abundant and ecologically critical components of the autotrophic communities in the pelagic realm. These micro-organisms colonized a variety of extreme environments including high salinity waters. However, the distribution of these organisms along strong salinity gradient has barely been investigated. The abundance and community structure of cyanobacteria and pico-eukaryotes were investigated along a natural continuous salinity gradient (1.8{\%} to 15.5{\%}) using flow cytometry.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Highest picophytoplankton abundances were recorded under salinity conditions ranging between 8.0{\%} and 11.0{\%} (1.3 x 106 to 1.4 x 106 cells ml-1). Two populations of picocyanobacteria (likely Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus) and 5 distinct populations of pico-eukaryotes were identified along the salinity gradient. The picophytoplankton cytometric-richness decreased with salinity and the most cytometrically diversified community (4 to 7 populations) was observed in the brackish-marine part of the lagoon (i.e. salinity below 3.5{\%}). One population of pico-eukaryote dominated the community throughout the salinity gradient and was responsible for the bloom observed between 8.0{\%} and 11.0{\%}. Finally only this halotolerant population and Prochlorococcus-like picocyanobacteria were identified in hypersaline waters (i.e. above 14.0{\%}). Salinity was identified as the main factor structuring the distribution of picophytoplankton along the lagoon. However, nutritive conditions, viral lysis and microzooplankton grazing are also suggested as potentially important players in controlling the abundance and diversity of picophytoplankton along the lagoon.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The complex patterns described here represent the first observation of picophytoplankton dynamics along a continuous gradient where salinity increases from 1.8{\%} to 15.5{\%}. This result provides new insight into the distribution of pico-autotrophic organisms along strong salinity gradients and allows for a better understanding of the overall pelagic functioning in saline systems which is critical for the management of these precious and climatically-stress ecosystems.},

INTRODUCTION Ultraviolet radiation is the main etiopathogenic factor in the most frequent forms of skin cancer. In the province of M{\'{a}}laga (Spain), continual exposure to the sun is common, especially as there are many tourists, and because it is a region where a great many actinic activities, both occupational and leisure, take place. Material and methods. Time series of solar UVB and UVA ultraviolet radiation and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measurements were determined in M{\'{a}}laga (36.5 N-4.7 W) using the recently formed Andalusian Network of Ultraviolet-Photosynthetic Measurements (UVIFAN) (http://uvifan.scai.uma.es). RESULTS Annual cycles of the total daily dose for all three radiation bands were presented from 1997 to the end of 2001. The maximum daily doses were observed in the summer months. The UV index, which reaches peak values during midday hours, ranged from maximum values of 7-8 during the summer months to values of 1-2 during the winter months. The ratios of PAR/UV-A doses do not vary throughout the year, although the UV-B/UV-A and UV-B/PAR ratios follow an annual variation pattern, with maximum values in the summer months, while the lowest values were obtained during the winter months. Conclusions. This data confirms that there are very high levels of UVA, UVB and PAR radiation in the province of M{\'{a}}laga in the summer months; therefore, it is extremely important to take specific photoprotective measures during this period to prevent both short-term burns and long-term photocarcinogenesis and photoaging.},

abstract = {The Guadalhorce River mouth (M{\'{a}}laga, Spain) constitutes a 67 ha coastal wetland formed by eight permanent ponds with diverse limnological and morphological features. As a consequence of its significance biodiversity, the Andalusian Government declared it as Paraje Natural in 1989, a very restrictive protection figure for sites with exceptional natural values. Habitat diversity resulting from limnological heterogeneity of the pond system could be of interest for Paraje Natural management. In this paper, we study limnological heterogeneity of the pond system in order to draw spatial and temporal patterns of the wetland and identify the main driving factors. We used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to analyze limnological, physico-chemical and biological (size abundance spectra of phytoplankton), data collected throughout two sampling years at six ponds. Our results suggest that there exists a marked spatial pattern in the wetland, mainly organized around the axis of eutrophication and marine influence. In addition, the ponds show a pronounced seasonal variability, mainly defined by temperature and conductivity. Limnodiversity in the Guadalhorce river mouth wetland is a key natural value, and it should be considered in the design of conservation strategies in the framework of global change.},

In view of the results, a hypothesis is posed where blooming species are those able to escape control by microzooplankton through a combination of predation avoidance mechanisms (e.g. larger size, colonies, spines, and toxic compounds) at the beginning of the bloom. Factors that help to enhance subsequent bloom development include positive feedback from the poor nutritional status of the phototrophic prey which adversely affects predation, inter-microzooplankton grazing and top-down grazing by mesozooplankton on microzooplankton. Blooming conditions are interpreted as physical or chemical perturbations disrupting the predator-prey controls that normally operate at the level of the microbial loop, opening 'loopholes' into which some phytoplankton species populations can explode. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {This chapter summarizes the known environmental consequences of Fe(III) respiration as well as related forms of respiration such as reduction of Mn(IV) and humic substances. The finding that specialized microorganisms are capable of Fe(III)-based respiration substantially changed the understanding of iron geochemistry in soils and sediments. The concept of metal-based respiration has been expanded from Fe(III) to a wide variety of redox-active metals and metalloids that have now been found to serve as terminal electron acceptors in microbial respiration. The chapter provides a brief overview of the major groups of Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms that grow at circumneutral pH. Sedimentation of soils naturally high in Fe(III) or Mn(IV) may also enhance Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction in aquatic sediment. Reoxidation of Fe(II) and Mn(II) produced as the result of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction can also be an important source of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) for microbial reduction. It is apparent that more research is required to better understand the mechanisms for Fe(III) oxide reduction by Fe(III)-respiring microorganisms (FRM) in pure culture, but elucidating the pathways for Fe(III) reduction in soils and sediments may be even more difficult. Further investigation into the biochemical and biogeochemical mechanisms of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction is required in order to fully realize the potential of these processes for environmental remediation.},

abstract = {The concentration of oxygen is fundamental tolake water quality and ecosystem functioning through itscontrol over habitat availability for organisms, redox reactions, and recycling of organic material. In many eutrophiclakes, oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) occurs annually during summer stratification. The temporal and spatial extent of summer hypolimneticanoxia is determined by interactions between the lake andits external drivers (e.g., catchment characteristics, nutrientloads, meteorology) as well as internal feedback mechanisms (e.g., organic matter recycling, phytoplankton blooms). Howthese drivers interact to control the evolution of lake anoxiaover decadal timescales will determine, in part, the futurelake water quality. In this study, we used a verticalone-dimensional hydrodynamic ecological model (GLMAED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchmentmodel (PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water qualitydynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA) over a37 year period. The calibration and validation of the lakemodel consisted of a global sensitivity evaluation as well asthe application of an optimization algorithm to improve thefit between observed and simulated data. We calculated stabilityindices (Schmidt stability, Birgean work, stored internalheat), identified spring mixing and summer stratificationperiods, and quantified the energy required for stratificationand mixing. To qualify which external and internal factorswere most important in driving the interannual variation insummer anoxia, we applied a random-forest classifier andmultiple linear regressions to modeled ecosystem variables (e.g., stratification onset and offset, ice duration, gross primaryproduction). Lake Mendota exhibited prolonged hypolimneticanoxia each summer, lasting between 50 60 d. The summer heat budget, the timing of thermal stratification, and the gross primary production in the epilimnion prior tosummer stratification were the most important predictors ofthe spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia periods inLake Mendota. Interannual variability in anoxia was largelydriven by physical factors: earlier onset of thermal stratificationin combination with a higher vertical stability stronglyaffected the duration and spatial extent of summer anoxia. A measured step change upward in summer anoxia in 2010was unexplained by the GLM-AED2 model. Although thecause remains unknown, possible factors include invasion bythe predacious zooplankton Bythotrephes longimanus. As theheat budget depended primarily on external meteorologicalconditions, the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxiain Lake Mendota is likely to increase in the near future as a result of projected climate change in the region.},

Resulting changes in phytoplankton community structure are expected to have a cascading effect on primary and export production, food web dynamics and the structure of the marine food web as well the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and bio-limiting elements in the sea. A review of current literature indicates cell size and elemental stoichiometry often respond predictably to abiotic conditions and follow biophysical rules that link environmental conditions to growth rates, and growth rates to food web interactions, and consequently to the biogeochemical cycling of elements. This suggests that cell size and elemental stoichiometry are promising ecophysiological traits for modelling and tracking changes in phytoplankton community structure in response to climate change. In turn, these changes are expected to have further impacts on phytoplankton community structure through as yet poorly understood secondary processes associated with trophic dynamics.},

Respiration rates measured were similar to 3 fmol cell(-1) h(-1). Respiration was markedly stimulated by glycerol, dihydroxyacetone and pyruvate, but not by yeast extract, succinate, and fumarate. These findings are discussed in view of genomic information on the dominant heterotrophic organisms in the community as well as the outcome of earlier studies on the behavior of halophilic prokaryotes in situ and in laboratory cultures. Despite the low in situ respiration rate, the oxygen uptake studies added information on the activities of the heterotrophic communities in salt-saturated ecosystems and on the substrates metabolized by the microorganisms present.},

In addition, the net ecosystem production and the picophytoplankton contribution to the air-sea CO 2 exchange process were investigated. The results showed that chlorophyll-a, carbon cycle parameters and picophytoplankton composition showed large seasonality, and the Guadalquivir Estuary plays an important role in the contribution of nutrient and suspended particular material over the year. Regarding picophytoplankton composition, the flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were the main populations in the studied area and their temporal and spatial distributions were complementary: the Prochlorococcus population showed its maximum concentration in May'07 and Jun'06 and in the surface oceanic water, whereas the Synechococcus population was at its maximum during Feb'07 and Nov'06, and off the Guadalquivir Estuary and Bay of C{\'{a}}diz. In addition, a relationship between the studied parameters and the fugacity of CO 2 was also observed, suggesting that primary production is an important factor in the regulation of this parameter in the studied area.

abstract = {Reservoirs have been constructed as clean energy sources in recent decades with various environmental impacts. Karst rivers typically exhibit high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations, whether and how reservoirs affect carbon cycling, especially organic carbon (OC)-related biogeochemical processes in karst rivers, are unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, multiple tracer methods (including fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM), ultraviolet (UV) absorption, and stable carbon ($\delta$13C) and radiocarbon ($\Delta$14C) isotopes) were utilized to track composition and property changes of both particulate OC (POC) and dissolved OC (DOC) along river-transition-reservoir transects in the Southwest China karst area. The changes in chemical properties indicated that from the river to the reservoir, terrestrial POC is largely replaced by phytoplankton-derived OC, while gradual coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) removal and addition of phytoplankton-derived OC to the DOC pool occurred as water flowed to the reservoir. Higher primary production in the transition area than that in the reservoir area was observed, which may be caused by nutrient released from suspended particles. Within the reservoir, the production surpassed degradation in the upper 5 m, resulting in a net DIC transformation into DOC and POC and terrestrial DOM degradation. The primary production was then gradually weakened and microbial degradation became more important down the profile. It is estimated that {\~{}}3.1–6.3 mg L−1 ({\~{}}15.5–31.5 mg-C m−2 ({\~{}}10–21{\%})) DIC was integrated into the OC pool through the biological carbon pump (BCP) process in the upper 5 m in the transition and reservoir areas. Our results emphasize the reservoir impact on riverine OC transport, and due to their characteristics, karst areas exhibit a higher BCP potential which is sensitive to human activities (more nutrient are provided) than non-karst areas.},

abstract = {The Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz, strategically situated between the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, has been the focus of attention of a few oceanographic studies dealing with the deep circulation in order to understand the dynamics of the dense plume of Mediterranean water. Much less attention has been paid to the surface pelagic layer which holds important living resources of commercial and ecological interest. This overview summarizes the recent advances that have been made concerning the regional oceanography of the northern half of this important basin from an interdisciplinary point of view. Probably the most relevant oceanographic feature of the basin is its strong seasonality, which is linked to the meteorologically-induced seasonality of the eastern boundary current system of the North Atlantic. The prominent cape Santa Maria divides the continental shelf off the southern Iberian Peninsula in two shelves of different shape that hold different oceanographic processes, which in turn determine the characteristics of the pelagic ecosystem. Mass and energy inputs from land as well as tidally-driven processes makes the wider eastern shelf be more productive while the narrower western shelf, cut by a sharp submarine canyon, is under the influence of the almost-permanent upwelling spot off cape San Vicente. Under easterlies, the west-going, warm coastal countercurrent that is observed in the eastern shelf may invade the western shelf thus connecting biologically both shelves in an east-to-west direction. Westerlies induce generalised upwelling off the southern Iberia Peninsula, which adds to the almost-permanent one off cape San Vicente and generates an upwelling jet that moves eastwards. Cape Santa Maria may deflect this flow by generating a cold filament that extends southward and diverts water from the western shelf to the open ocean. This pattern of circulation hampers the biological connection between shelves in the west-to-east direction, which is therefore less effective. The eastern shelf is prone to hold a cyclonic circulation cell during summer. This cell seems to be part of the reproductive strategy of fish species like anchovy with significant commercial interest in the region. The coupling between spawning and circulation is particularly beneficial under westerlies, when productivity in the eastern shelf is enhanced and the plankton is confined within the cyclonic cell. Easterlies favour oligotrophy and the westward export of plankton, which has an adverse effect on the recruitment and correlates low anchovy catches with periods of noticeable easterly intensity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we use “mizer”, a size spectrum modelling framework, to investigate the consequences of including the seasonal processes of plankton blooms and batch spawning in the model dynamics. A multispecies size spectrum model is constructed using 12 common North Sea fish species, with growth, predation, and mortality explicitly modelled, before simulating both seasonal plankton blooms and batch spawning of fish (using empirical data on the spawning patterns of each species). The effect of seasonality on the community size spectrum is investigated; it is found that with seasonal processes included, the species spectra are more varied over time, while the aggregated community spectrum remains fairly similar. Growth of seasonally spawning mature individuals drops significantly during peak reproduction, although lifetime growth curves follow nonseasonal ones closely. On analysing properties of the community spectrum under different fishing scenarios, seasonality generally causes more varied spectrum slopes and lower yields. Under seasonal conditions, increasing fishing effort also results in greater temporal variability of fisheries yields due to truncation of the community spectrum towards smaller sizes. Further work is needed to evaluate robustness of management strategies in the context of a wider range of seasonal processes and behavioural strategies, as well as longer term environmental variability and change. {\textcopyright} 2016 Published by NRC Research Press.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Seasonal changes in rates of gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and respiration (R) were determined from frequent automated profiles of dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature in a clear-water polymictic lake. Metabolic rate calculations were made using a method that integrates rates across the entire depth profile and includes DO exchange between depth layers driven by mixed-layer deepening and eddy diffusivity. During full mixing, NEP was close to zero throughout the water column, and GPP and R were reduced 2{\&}ndash;10 times compared to stratified periods. When present, the metalimnion contributed 21 {\%} and 27 {\%} to whole-lake areal rates of GPP and R, respectively. Net autotrophy prevailed in the epilimnion (NEP = 11 +-  14 mmol O2 m-3 d-1 ; mean +- SD) compared to balanced production in the metalimnion (NEP = 2 +- 19 mmol O2 m-3 d-1 ) and net heterotrophic conditions in hypolimnic waters (NEP = -15 +- 24 mmol O2 m-3 d-1 ). Positive NEP occurred in the metalimnion during periods when the photic depth extended below the mixed-layer depth. Although the single-sonde method estimated higher areal GPP (19 {\%} ) and R (14 {\%} ) compared to the two depth-integrated approaches, differences were not significant. During stratification, daily variability in epilimnetic DO was dominated by metabolism (46 {\%} ) and air{\&}ndash;water gas exchange (44 {\%} ). Fluxes related to mixed-layer deepening dominated in meta- and hypolimnic waters (49 {\%} and 64 {\%} ), while eddy diffusion (1 {\%} and 14 {\%} ) was less important. Although air{\&}ndash;water gas exchange rates differed among the three formulations of gas-transfer velocity, this had no significant effect on metabolic rates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) with sulfate as terminal electron acceptor has been reported for various environments, including freshwater habitats, and also, nitrate and nitrite were recently shown to act as electron acceptors for methane oxidation in eutrophic freshwater habitats. Radiotracer experiments with sediment material of Lake Constance, an oligotrophic freshwater lake, were performed to follow 14CO2 formation from 14CH4 in sediment incubations in the presence of different electron acceptors, namely, nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, or oxygen. Whereas 14CO2 formation without and with sulfate addition was negligible, addition of nitrate increased 14CO2 formation significantly, suggesting that AOM could be coupled to denitrification. Nonetheless, denitrification-dependent AOM rates remained at least 1 order of magnitude lower than rates of aerobic methane oxidation. Using molecular techniques, putative denitrifying methanotrophs belonging to the NC10 phylum were detected on the basis of the pmoA and 16S rRNA gene sequences. These findings show that sulfate-dependent AOM was insignificant in Lake constant sediments. However, AOM can also be coupled to denitrification in this oligotrophic freshwater habitat, providing first indications that this might be a widespread process that plays an important role in mitigating methane emissions.},

abstract = {Rates of methanogenesis in freshwater sediments have been shown to increase with inputs of phytoplankton biomass. Although many studies have shown the importance of resource quality for decomposition, little is known of the importance of substrate quality on rates of methanogenesis. Here, we studied the effects of lipid content and taxonomic affiliation of phytoplankton biomass on rates of methanogenesis in lake sediment slurries from five lakes differing in trophic status. Substrate quantity had a positive effect on methanogenesis despite differing trophic status. Furthermore, we observed that phytoplankton biomass quality, in terms of lipid content, enhanced methanogenesis rates. However, rates of methanogenesis between lake sediments treated with Scenedemus obliquus or Microcystis aeruginosa did not differ when lipid content was held constant. Phytoplankton lipid content has been shown to increase when nutrients are limiting, which may result in an increase in substrate quality for methanogenesis with eutrophication. However, our study revealed that responses of substrate quantity to nutrient enrichment likely outpace the effects of resource quality and may result in a net increase in CH4 emissions from eutrophied lakes. Interestingly, the resource quality feedback may at least partially reduce the potential effect of eutrophication on lake methanogenesis.},

abstract = {Estimates of in situ nitrifying activity have been made in the hypolimnetic water column and surface 1.0 cm of profundal sediments at 2 sites in Grasmere, a mesotrophic lake in the English Lake District. Increases of nitrate concentrations were used to estimate nitrification in the water column whereas a mini-core technique, involving the use of a nitrification inhibitor (allylthiourea), was used to estimate the rate in surface sediments. The pattern of oxygen depletion in the water column was used to estimate the maximum depth to which sediments affect the overlying water. Nitrification in the sediment and in the water column made approximately equal contributions to the total areal oxygen deficit and, as a whole, nitrification accounted for 15-20{\%} of the total oxygen depletion. There was no significant difference in oxygen depletion due to nitrification between the 2 sites. Attempts were made, using the nitrification potential technique, to determine the depth distribution of nitrifying activity in the surface 1.0 cm of sediment. {\textcopyright} 1984 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry has become a standard method to analyze bacterioplankton. Analy- sis of samples by flow cytometry is automatic, but it is followed by manual classification of the bac- terioplankton groups in flow cytometry standard (FCS) files. This classification is a time consum- ing and subjective task performed by manually drawing the limits of the groups present in cytograms, a process referred to as gating. The automation of flow cytometry data processing based on pattern recognition techniques could provide an efficient tool to overcome some of these disadvantages. Here, we propose the use of model-based clustering techniques for the automatic detection of low (LNA) and high (HNA) nucleic acid bacterioplankton groups in FCS files. To val- idate our method, we compared the automatic classification with a flow cytometry database from a 9 yr time series collected in the central Cantabrian Sea that had been manually analyzed. The correlation between automatic and manual gating methods was {\textgreater}0.9 for cell counts and 0.7 to 0.95 for side scatter values, a proxy of cell size. In addition, no significant differences were found in the mean annual cycle of LNA and HNA cell abundance depicted by both methods. We also quanti- fied the subjectivity of manual gating. The coefficient of variation for heterotrophic bacteria counts obtained by different analysts was around 10 to 20{\%}. Our results suggest that the combi- nation of flow cytometry and automatic gating provides a valuable tool to analyze microbial com- munities objectively and accurately, allowing us to safely compare bacterioplankton samples from different environments.

abstract = {The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) is one of the largest biomes on Earth. It has a semi-enclosed surface area of about 2 9 10 7 km 2 and mean depth of nearly 5 km and includes a broad range of habitats from warm, light-saturated, nutrient-starved surface waters to the cold, nutrient-rich abyss. Microorgan-isms are found throughout the water column and are vertically stratified by their genetically determined metabolic capabilities that establish physiological tolerances to temperature, light, pressure, as well as organic and inorganic growth substrates. Despite the global significance of the NPSG for energy and matter transformations and its role in the oceanic carbon cycle, it is grossly undersampled and not well char-acterized with respect to ecosystem structure and dynamics. Since October 1988, interdisciplinary teams of scientists from the University of Hawaii and around the world have been investigating the NPSG ecosystem at Station ALOHA (A Long-term Olig-otrophic Habitat Assessment), a site chosen to be representative of this expansive oligotrophic habitat, with a focus on microbial processes and biogeo-chemistry. At the start of this comprehensive field study, the NPSG was thought to be a ''Climax'' community with a relatively stable plankton com-munity structure and relatively low variability in key microbiological rates and processes. Now, after nearly three decades of observations and experimentation we present a new view of this old ocean, one that highlights temporal variability in ecosystem pro-cesses across a broad range of scales from diel to decadal and beyond. Our revised paradigm is built on the strength of high-quality time-series observations, on insights from the application of state-of-the-art –omics techniques (genomics, transcriptomics, pro-teomics and metabolomics) and, more recently, the discoveries of novel microorganisms and metabolic processes. Collectively, these efforts have led to a new understanding of trophic dynamics and population interactions in the NPSG. A comprehensive under-standing of the environmental controls on microbial rates and processes, from genomes to biomes, will be required to inform the scientific community and the public at large about the potential impacts of human-induced climate change. The pace of new discovery, and the importance of integrating this new knowl-edge into conceptual paradigms and predictive models, is an enormous contemporary challenge with great scientific and societal relevance.},

Although part of this uncertainty can be attributed to the difficulties in measuring highly variable fluxes, it is also the result of a lack of a clear accounting methodology, particularly about what constitutes new emissions and potential new sinks. In this paper, we review the main processes involved in the generation of GHG in reservoir systems and propose a simple approach to quantify the reservoir GHG footprint in terms of the net changes in GHG fluxes to the atmosphere induced by damming, that is, ‘what the atmosphere sees.' The approach takes into account the pre-impoundment GHG balance of the landscape, the temporal evolution of reservoir GHG emission profile as well as the natural emissions that are displaced to or away from the reservoir site resulting from hydrological and other changes. It also clarifies the portion of the reservoir carbon burial that can potentially be considered an offset to GHG emissions.},

Over the past two decades, research on microbial communities of pelagic ecosystems has yielded data suggestive of cybernetic-like regulation operating within these communities. As presently conceived, phagotrophic protozoa have a pivotal role in such regulation as a consequence of their rapid growth, grazing, and nutrient regenerative capabilities. Feedback controls within microbial food webs may have significant effects on distal portions of pelagic ecosystems, including the fate of organic detritus and metazoan production.},

abstract = {Microplankton metabolism was studied in the Urdaibai estuary from June 1996 to May 1997 to investigate the factors that control the autotrophic-heterotrophic balance in three zones of contrasting trophic status. Gross primary production (GPP) and dark oxygen consumption (R) were measured from the upper eutrophic reaches to the lower marine segment for unfractionated samples as well as for nanoplankton (? 20 ?m) and ultraplankton (? 5 ?m). Micro- plankton composition differed in the three segments and the peaks of abundance were uncoupled. Microplankton bio- mass both as carbon content and chlorophyll a concentration decreased seaward. Size-fractionated metabolism was to a great extent conducted by the dominant species in the upper and middle reaches, where GPP and R rates were frequently coupled. In the lower marine estuary GPP experienced marked seasonal changes while R rates were rather constant and uncoupled to GPP. In the upper and lower estuary the gross primary production:respiration (P:R) ratio of the non- fractionated samples were ? 1 only during peak values of production, whilst in the middle estuary they were almost always ? 1. Ultraplankton was generally heterotrophic in the three zones. The relative importance of the ? 5 ?mfraction increased seaward for both GPP and R rates. This size class was responsible for most of the oxygen consumption in the middle and lower estuary, while in the upper estuary the 5–20 ?m size fraction was also relevant. During periods of enhanced phytoplankton growth, less than 20{\%} of the total GPP was instantaneously respired in the three segments. In periods between peaks, only in the middle estuary was some percentage of the GPP not instantaneously processed. The percentage of the fractionated primary production respired in each size fraction was highly variable, although the highest values were found in the ? 5 ?m for all stations. Introduction},

abstract = {Nanoplankton and picoplankton abundance and community grazing on picoplankton were determined in summer and autumn at several stations in a productive coastal environment (Georges Bank, NW Atlantic Ocean) and in an oligotrophic oceanic ecosystem (Sargasso Sea). Ranges of heterotrophic nanoplankton (HNAN) abundance were 1.2 to 3.6 x 10(3) cells ml(-1) on Georges Bank, and 2.2 to 6.8 x 10(2) cells ml(-1) in the Sargasso Sea. Ranges of phototrophic nanoplankton (PNAN) abundance in these ecosystems were 1.9 to 6.0 x 10(3) and 1.3 to 4.7 x 10(2), respectively. Mixotrophic nanoplankton (MNAN), operationally defined here as chloroplast-bearing nanoplankton that ingested fluorescent tracers, comprised an average of 12 to 17{\%} of PNAN in surface waters in both environments during August and October. Mixotrophs at specific stations constituted as much as 38{\%} of total PNAN abundance on Georges Bank and 30{\%} in the Sargasso Sea. Mixotrophs represented up to 39{\%} of the total phagotrophic nanoplankton abundance (MNAN/[MNAN + HNAN]). Community grazing impact was estimated from the disappearance of fluorescent prey surrogates (fluorescently labeled bacteria, FLB; cyanobacteria, FLC; and {\textless}3 mu m algae, FLA). Absolute grazing rates (total picoplankton cells removed d(-1)) on Georges Bank exceeded those in the Sargasso Sea due to the greater abundances of predators and prey. However, there was overlap in the specific grazing losses at the 2 sites (ranges = 0.08 to 0.38 d(-1) in the coastal ocean and 0.05 to 0.24 d(-1) in the oligotrophic ocean). Rates of bacterivory were in approximate balance with rates of bacterial production (H-3-thymidine uptake), but production exceeded bacterivory on Georges Bank during the summer cruise. These data are among the first documenting the impact of grazing on picoplankton in these environments, and they are consistent with the prediction that nanoplanktonic protists are major predators of picoplankton. While the proportion of phototrophs that are phagotrophic was highly variable, our study indicates that algal mixotrophy is widespread in the marine environment, occurring in both coastal and oligotrophic sites, and should be considered quantitatively in microbial food web investigations.},

abstract = {Reservoirs emit large amounts of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere relative to their small surface area globally. Among the different pathways of reservoir CH4 emissions, bubbling from the sediments (ebullition) and diffusion from the water surface are major contributors of CH4 efflux. The magnitude of ebullition and diffusion can vary substantially over space and time in large reservoirs. However, it is unclear how the drivers of ebullition and diffusion vary along a reservoir's longitudinal gradient, particularly in small reservoirs. We measured ebullition, diffusion, and eight environmental driver variables at four transects along a longitudinal gradient within a small, eutrophic reservoir. We used time series modeling to examine how the drivers of ebullition and diffusion varied among transects. Sediment-water interface temperature, inflow discharge, and wind speed were the most important drivers of CH4 ebullition in upstream transects of the reservoir, while phytoplankton biomass was the most important driver of ebullition in the downstream transect closest to the dam. Strikingly, CH4 ebullition dynamics were extremely well captured by the time series models, as the modeled rates for the furthest upstream transect closely matched the observed rates throughout the monitoring period. In contrast, CH4 diffusion dynamics were harder to model, with phytoplankton biomass as the primary driver of diffusion across all transects. Our results indicate that multiple drivers affect CH4 emissions along a small reservoir's longitudinal gradient and should be considered when upscaling site measurements to reservoir-wide CH4 emissions and ultimately regional or global estimates.},

Climate change is expected to additionally affect water supply and demand. Here, analyses of climate change and direct human impacts on the terrestrial water cycle are presented and compared using a multimodel approach. Seven global hydrological models have been forced with multiple climate projections, and with and without taking into account impacts of human interventions such as dams and water withdrawals on the hydrological cycle. Model results are analyzed for different levels of global warming, allowing for analyses in line with temperature targets for climate change mitigation. The results indicate that direct human impacts on the water cycle in some regions, e.g., parts of Asia and in the western United States, are of the same order of magnitude, or even exceed impacts to be expected for moderate levels of global warming (+2 K). Despite some spread in model projections, irrigation water consumption is generally projected to increase with higher global mean temperatures. Irrigation water scarcity is particularly large in parts of southern and eastern Asia, and is expected to become even larger in the future.},

abstract = {Modelling the size-abundance spectrum of phytoplankton has proven to be a very useful tool for the analysis of physical-biological coupling and the vertical flux of carbon in oceanic ecosystems at different scales. A frequent observation relates high phytoplankton biovolume in productive regions with flatter spectrum slope and the opposite in oligotrophic ecosystems. Rather than this, the relationship between high biovolume phytoplankton assemblages and flatter size-abundance spectra does not correspond with measurements of the phytoplankton community in the Atlantic Ocean open waters. As part of the Malaspina Circunnavegation Expedition, sixty seven sampling stations within the Atlantic Ocean covering six oceanographic provinces, at different seasons, produced a complete set of phytoplankton size-spectra whose slope and biovolume did not show any obvious interrelation. In these oligotrophic sites, small (procaryotes) and medium-size (nanoplankton) cells are responsible for the most part of biovolume, and their response to environmental conditions does not apply to changes in the size-abundance spectrum slope as expected in richer, large-cell dominated ecosystems.},

abstract = {Oxygen concentration is both an indicator and driver of water quality in lakes. Decreases in oxygen concentration leads to altered ecosystem function as well as harmful consequences for aquatic biota, such as fishes. The responses of oxygen dynamics in lakes to climate-related drivers, such as temperature and wind speed, are well documented for lake surface waters. However, much less is known about how the oxic environment of bottom waters, especially the timing and magnitude of anoxia in eutrophic lakes, responds to changes in climate drivers. Understanding how important ecosystem states, such as hypolimnetic anoxia, may respond to differing climate scenarios requires a model that couples physical-biological conditions and sufficiently captures the density stratification that leads to strong oxygen gradients. Here, we analyzed the effects of changes in three important meteorological drivers (air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) on hypolimnetic anoxia in a eutrophic, north temperate lake using the anoxic factor as an index that captures both the temporal and spatial extent of anoxia. Air temperature and relative humidity were found to have a positive correlation with anoxic factor, while wind speed had a negative correlation. Air temperature was found to have the greatest potential impact of the three drivers on the anoxic factor, followed by wind speed and then relative humidity. Across the scenarios of climate variability, variation in the simulated anoxic factor was primarily due to changes in the timing of onset and decay of stratification. Given the potential for future changes in climate, especially increases in air temperature, this study provides important insight into how these changes will alter lake water quality.},

abstract = {The seasonal composition of phytoplankton communities was investigated in a Mediterranean brackish area (Varano lagoon). Twelve stations were sampled monthly from March 1997 to February 1998. Numbers of prokaryotic and eukaryotic picophytoplankton cells were estimated by epifluorescence microscopy, while larger phytoplankton (nano and micro fractions) were enumerated by the Utermohl settling technique. Picophytoplankton densities ranged from 0.7 to 448.6 cells x 106 l-1. Nano- and microphytoplankton abundances varied between 0.2 and 7.9 cells x 106 l-1. The picoplankton fraction was represented mainly by cyanobacteria and the Utermohl fraction by nano-sized phytoflagellates (56.2{\%}) and diatoms (20.1{\%}). The phytoflagellates had a greater abundance over time while diatoms reached the highest densities in summer and fall. In Varano lagoon, phytoplankton development is related to  nitrogen-poor' waters and to phosphorus availability. Suspension-feeding bivalves (Mytilus galloprovincialis) are sufficiently abundant to filter a volume equivalent to the volume of Varano lagoon at least once daily. These observations suggest that grazing exerts an important influence on phytoplankton dynamics, mainly on the micro fraction, and that diatoms seem to play an important role in the food web dynamics of this coastal fishery.},

abstract = {Cell size affects many aspects of phytoplankton physiology and ecology over several levels of organization, including individuals, populations, and communities. Small cell size is advantageous in terms of nutrient uptake, light absorption, and avoidance of sedimentation in stratified waters. These factors explain that small cells dominate phytoplankton assemblages in oligotrophic environments. The dominance of larger species in productive ecosystems can be explained by a combination of physiological and trophic mechanisms. First, large phytoplankton, in spite of geometrical constraints on resource acquisition, are able to sustain metabolic and growth rates as high as, or even higher than, those of smaller cells, particularly when resources are plentiful. Second, large phytoplankton, compared to their smaller counterparts, are less strictly controlled by grazing, as a result of the difference between their generation time and that of their predators. The size structure of phytoplankton strongly affects the efficiency of the biological pump. In unproductive ecosystems, where phytoplankton are dominated by small cells, most of the newly produced organic matter is remineralized within the euphotic layer, thus leaving little potential for export. By contrast, phytoplankton assemblages dominated by larger cells are typical of dynamic environments that are subject to perturbations leading to enhanced resource supply and productivity. In these ecosystems, production and consumption of organic matter are decoupled and the biological pump effectively transports biogenic carbon toward the ocean's interior, thus contributing to CO2 sequestration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {During a summer cruise in the Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz area (Southern Iberian Peninsula), an upwelling episode off the eastern coast of Cape Santa Mar{\'{i}}a was noted. The observed temperature field data suggested an anticyclonic circulation from NW to SE and a velocity of the associated surface currents ranging between 10 and 15 cm s –1 was estimated. Research was carried out on the physical–biological coupling by analysing the influence of these hydrodynamic patterns on the mesoscale distribution of several chemical and biological variables. During the cruise, nitrate concen- tration, total chlorophyll, chlorophyll ({\textgreater}20 $\mu$m), phaeopigments and TEP bulk concentration were measured. The distribution of biological variables appears to be organized by physical forcing. The upwelling area acts as a notable disturbance in the area. A sequence of maxima of different vari- ables classified as bloom phases was observed, arranged in the same direction as dominant currents. A clear frontal structure in radial transects was also apparent. Discussion focusses on the variabil- ity of the hydrodynamic patterns observed in the framework of previous observations and the role of physical forcing, moulding the biological distributions and altering their spatial correlations. Special reference is made to TEP, as this variable is scarcely analysed in extensive field studies. The distri- bution of TEP patches in the area was heterogeneous, which has been discussed in the framework of current theory. Chlorophyll ({\textgreater}20 $\mu$m), phaeopigment ratio and TEP concentration maxima had no direct spatial correlation with chlorophyll maxima. The sequence of typical processes in phyto- plankton bloom phases and the influence that hydrodynamics has both on environmental suitability for growth and on displacement of patches, could explain the distribution of these biological vari- ables in the area. Subsequent studies on hydrodynamics variability are suggested as a valuable tool for the future understanding of biological processes in the region.},

abstract = {Rivers in Mediterranean-climate and other semi-arid regions tend to be more heavily impounded and thus their hydrology more strongly affected than rivers in humid climates because demand for water is greater (to supply irrigated agriculture) and runoff is out-of-phase with demand. The impounded runoff index (ratio of reservoir capacity divided by mean annual runoff) is 0.8 on the Sacramento and 1.2 on the San Joaquin Rivers of California, much higher than rates: encountered in humid Atlantic climate regions. As a result of these high levels of impoundment, the overall magnitude and seasonal distribution of flow has changed substantially. Flood peaks tend to be reduced: the Q2 declined on average 53 and 81{\%} in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins, respectively. On many rivers, summer baseflows have increased to supply irrigation diversions downstream, creating a flatter hydrograph that no longer supports dynamic channel processes and the aquatic ecosystem that depends upon such channel dynamics. Vegetation has encroached in the formerly active channels of many rivers in response to reduced flood scour and sediment supply. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mixotrophic organisms combine autotrophic and heterotrophic nutrition and are abundant in both freshwater and marine environments. Recent observations indicate that mixotrophs constitute a large fraction of the biomass, bacterivory, and primary production in oligotrophic environments. While mixotrophy allows greater flexibility in terms of resource acquisition, any advantage must be traded off against an associated increase in metabolic costs, which appear to make mixotrophs uncompetitive relative to obligate autotrophs and heterotrophs. Using an idealized model of cell physiology and community competition, we identify one mechanism by which mixotrophs can effectively outcompete specialists for nutrient elements. At low resource concentrations, when the uptake of nutrients is limited by diffusion toward the cell, the investment in cell membrane transporters can be minimized. In this situation, mixotrophs can acquire limiting elements in both organic and inorganic forms, outcompeting their specialist competitors that can utilize only one of these forms. This advantage can be enough to offset as much as a twofold increase in additional metabolic costs incurred by mixotrophs. This mechanism is particularly relevant for the maintenance of mixotrophic populations and productivity in the highly oligotrophic subtropical oceans.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown the utility of delta(15)N to model trophic structure and contaminant bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs. However, cross-system comparisons in delta(15)N can be complicated by differences in delta(15)N at the base of the food chain. Such baseline variation in delta(15)N is difficult to resolve using plankton because of the large temporal variability in the delta(15)N of small organisms that have fast nitrogen turnover. Comparisons using large primary consumers, which have stable tissue isotopic signatures because of their slower nitrogen turnover, show that delta(15)N increases markedly with the human population density in the lake watershed. This shift in delta(15)N likely reflects the high delta(15)N of human sewage. Correcting for this baseline variation in delta(15)N, we report that, contrary to expectations based on previous food-web analysis, the food chains leading up to fish varied by about only one trophic level among the 40 lakes studied. Our results also suggest that the delta(15)N signatures of nitrogen at the base of the food chain will provide a useful tool in the assessment of anthropogenic nutrient inputs.},

abstract = {Anoxic sediments from Rotsee (Switzerland) were analyzed for the presence and diversity of methanogens by using molecular tools and for methanogenic activity by using radiotracer techniques, in addition to the measurement of chemical profiles. After PCR-assisted sequence retrieval of the 16S rRNA genes (16S rDNA) from the anoxic sediment of Rotsee, cloning, and sequencing, a phylogenetic analysis identified two clusters of sequences and four separated clones. The sequences in cluster 1 grouped with those of Methanosaeta spp., whereas the sequences in cluster 2 comprised the methanogenic endosymbiont of Plagiopyla nasuta. Discriminative oligonucleotide probes were constructed against both clusters and two of the separated clones. These probes were used subsequently for the analysis of indigenous methanogens in a core of the sediment, in addition to domain- specific probes against members of the domains Bacteria and Archaea and the fluorescent stain 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), by fluorescent in situ hybridization. After DAPI staining, the highest microbial density was obtained in the upper sediment layer; this density decreased with depth from (1.01 ± 0.25) x 1010 to (2.62 ± 0.58) x 1010 cells per g of sediment (dry weight). This zone corresponded to that of highest metabolic activity, as indicated by the ammonia, alkalinity, and pH profiles, whereas the methane profile was constant. Probes Eub338 and Arch915 detected on average 16 and 6{\%} of the DAPI-stained cells as members of the domains Bacteria and Archaea, respectively. Probe Rotcl1 identified on average 4{\%} of the DAPI-stained cells as Methanosaeta spp., which were present throughout the whole core. In contrast, probe Rotcl2 identified only 0.7{\%} of the DAPI-stained cells as relatives of the methanogenic endosymbiont of P. nasuta, which was present exclusively in the upper 2 cm of the sediment. Probes Rotp13 and Rotp17 did not detect any cells. The spatial distribution of the two methanogenic populations corresponded well to the methane production rates determined by incubation with either [14C]acetate or [14C]bicarbonate. Methanogenesis from acetate accounted for almost all of the total methane production, which concurs with the predominance of acetoclastic Methanosaeta spp. that represented on average 91{\%} of the archaeal population. Significant hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was found only in the organically enriched upper 2 cm of the sediment, where the probably hydrogenotrophic relatives of the methanogenic endosymbiont of P. nasuta, accounting on average for 7{\%} of the archaeal population, were also detected.},

abstract = {In the eutrophic Ghar El Melh Lagoon (GML, Tunisia), the distribution of heterotrophic prokaryotes, pico- and nanophytoplankton was studied at five stations in November 2012 at the single cell level, along with environmental factors. Flow cytometry analysis of ultraplankton ({\textless}10 $\mu$m) resolved (i) two heterotrophic prokaryote groups, low and high nucleic acid contents (LNA and HNA, respectively), and (ii) eight to nine ultraphytoplankton groups (cryptophyte-like cells, two nanoeukaryote subgroups, two picoeukaryote subgroups and three Synechococcus-like cells subgroups). Prochlorococcus was not detected. According to redundancy analysis (RDA), a significant difference was found in the distribution of the ultraplankton between stations (F = 2.61, p {\textless} 0.05); maximum proliferations of heterotrophic prokaryotes were observed in the inner parts of the lagoon at stations 3, 4 and 5 affected by urban, agricultural and industrial discharges. Ultraphytoplankton concentrations were the highest near the outlet of the lagoon at stations 1 and 2 influenced by freshwater outflow and oligotrophic Mediterranean water inflow, respectively. At station 1, the large ultraphytoplankton concentration derives from the high abundance of cryptophyte-like cells favoured by the freshwater outflow whereas at station 2, the input of oligotrophic Mediterranean water enhanced the abundance of Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes at the expense of nanoeukaryotes. Two trophic regimes were thus differentiated in GML.},

abstract = {Throughout Earth history, almost all preserved organic matter has been incorporated in marine sediments deposited under oxygenated waters along continental margins. Given modern oceanic productivity and sediment burial rates of 50 × 1015 and 0.16 × 1015 gC yr−1, respectively, organic preservation in the marine environment is {\textless} 0.5{\%} efficient. Although correlative information is often used to suggest that productivity, sediment accumulation rate, bottom water oxicity, and organic matter source are key variables, the mechanisms governing sedimentary organic matter preservation have remained unclear. The factors which directly determine preservation vary with depositional regime, but have in common a critical interaction between organic and inorganic materials over locally variable time scales. More than 90{\%} of total sedimentary organic matter from a wide variety of marine depositional environments cannot be physically separated from its mineral matrix. This strongly associated organic component varies directly in concentration with sediment surface area and thus appears to be sorbed to mineral grains. Sediments accumulating outside deltas along continental shelves and upper slopes characteristically exhibit mineral surface area loadings approximately equivalent to a single molecular covering. These monolayer-equivalent coatings include a fraction of reversibly bound organic molecules that are intrinsically labile, but resist appreciable mineralization as they pass rapidly through oxygenated surface sediments and are preserved within underlying anoxic deposits. The delivery of mineral surface area is the primary control on organic matter preservation within these expansive coastal margin regions where roughly 45{\%} of all organic carbon accumulates. Deltaic sediments account for roughly another 45{\%} of global carbon burial, but often exhibit much less than monolayer-equivalent organic coatings. This pattern is seen in periodically oxygenated sediments off the mouth of the Amazon River, even though the component clastic minerals are discharged by the river with monolayer coatings. Comparably extensive losses of organic matter, including distinct particles such as pollen grains, occur in the surfaces of deep-sea turbidites in which long term reaction with O2 is clearly the causative factor. Sub-monolayer organic coatings also are observed in continental rise and abyssal plain sediments where slower accumulation rates and deeper O2 penetration depths result in increased oxygen exposure times and little ({\~{}} 5{\%} of the global total) organic matter preservation. A transition zone between monolayer and sub-monolayer organic coatings apparently occurs on lower continental slopes, and is marked along the Washington coast by parallel offshore decreases in total organic matter and pollen between 2000–3000 m water depth. Sediments underlying highly productive, low-oxygen coastal waters such as off Peru and western Mexico are characteristically rich in organic matter, but account for only {\~{}} 5{\%} of total organic carbon burial. These sediments show a direct relationship between organic matter content and mineral surface area, but at organic loadings 2–5 times a monolayer equivalent. Organic materials sorbed in excess of a monolayer thus also may be partially protected. Such high sedimentary organic contents may result from equilibration with DOM-rich porewaters, or very brief O2 exposure times which allow preservation of extremely oxygen-sensitive organic materials such as pigments and unsaturated lipids. Thus organic matter preservation throughout much of the ocean may be controlled largely by competition between sorption at different protective thresholds and oxic degradation. Future research strategies should be specifically directed at delineating the mechanisms for organic matter preservation in marine sediments. In particular, special effort is needed to determine the amounts and types of sorbed organic materials and the nature of their bonding to mineral surfaces. The extent and dynamics with which organic molecules are partitioned between porewaters and solid phases also should be determined, as well as the effects of these phase associations on their reactivities toward chemical and biological agents. In addition, processes for slow oxic (and suboxic) degradation of organic materials bear investigation in deep-sea sediments, as well as in other extreme environments such as oxidizing turbidites, weathering shales, and soils. Such studies should include characterizations of hydrolysis-resistant organic materials and emphasize the complementary use of biochemical compositions with readily separable particles such as pollen to calibrate and typify the mechanisms and stages of sedimentary organic degradation.},

abstract = {Temperature and nutrient availability play key roles in controlling the pathways and rates at which energy and materials move through ecosystems. These factors have also changed dramatically on Earth over the past century as human activities have intensified. Although significant effort has been devoted to understanding the role of temperature and nutrients in isolation, less is known about how these two factors interact to influence ecological processes. Recent advances in ecological stoichiometry and metabolic ecology provide a useful framework for making progress in this area, but conceptual synthesis and review are needed to help catalyze additional research. Here, we examine known and potential interactions between temperature and nutrients from a variety of physiological, community, and ecosystem perspectives. We first review patterns at the level of the individual, focusing on four traits – growth, respiration, body size, and elemental content – that should theoretically govern how temperature and nutrients interact to influence higher levels of biological organization. We next explore the interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on populations, communities, and food webs by synthesizing information related to community size spectra, biomass distributions, and elemental composition. We use metabolic theory to make predictions about how population-level secondary production should respond to interactions between temperature and resource supply, setting up qualitative predictions about the flows of energy and materials through metazoan food webs. Last, we examine how temperature–nutrient interactions influence processes at the whole-ecosystem level, focusing on apparent vs. intrinsic activation energies of ecosystem processes, how to represent temperature–nutrient interactions in ecosystem models, and patterns with respect to nutrient uptake and organic matter decomposition. We conclude that a better understanding of interactions between temperature and nutrients will be critical for developing realistic predictions about ecological responses to multiple, simultaneous drivers of global change, including climate warming and elevated nutrient supply.},

abstract = {Lakes are critical natural resources that are sensitive to changes in climate. There are more than 100 million lakes globally 1 , holding 87{\%} of Earth's liquid sur­ face freshwater 2. Lakes support a global heritage of biodiversity 3 and provide key ecosystem services 4 ; as such, they are included in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals committed to water resources (Goal {\#}6) and the impacts of climate change (Goal {\#}13) 5. Lakes are also key indicators of local and regional water­ shed changes, making them useful for detecting Earth's response to climate change 6. Specifically, variables such as lake surface temperature, water level and extent, ice cover and lake colour are recognized by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) because they contribute critically to the characterization of Earth's climate. The scientific value of lake research makes it an essential component of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Lakes are already responding rapidly to climate change. Some of the most pervasive and concerning physical consequences of climate change on lakes are the loss of ice cover 7 , changes in evaporation and water budgets 8,9 , warming surface water temperature 10 and alterations in mixing regimes 11. These lake variables interact with one another (Fig. 1), complicating our ability to predict lake physical responses to climatic variations. For example, changes in ice cover and water temperature modify (and are influenced by) evaporation rates 9 , which can subsequently alter lake levels and surface water extent 12. In the absence of precipitation changes, one of the effects of reduced ice cover, higher surface water temperatures and increased lake evaporation rates could be reductions in lake level and extent. However, land surface runoff and direct precipitation to the lake also affect lake level and extent, which are subject to climatic variations across the lake catchment, reinforcing or even offsetting the effects mediated by evaporation. Such sen­ sitive balances between climatically driven factors lead to spatially variable outcomes for lake-climate inter­ actions that require further elucidation to understand and predict. In this Review, we summarize the responses of key physical lake variables and processes to global climate change, including ice cover, surface water tempera­ ture, evaporation, water levels and mixing regimes, and outline their ecological consequences (Fig. 1). We also identify research needs for improving our global understanding of lake responses to climatic variability and change, including enhancing satellite observa­ tions and in situ technology for monitoring both small lakes (which dominate the global lake distribution) and large lakes with high spatial heterogeneity, developing global­ scale modelling techniques to better predict lake responses under climate change and establishing Global lake responses to climate change Abstract | Climate change is one of the most severe threats to global lake ecosystems. Lake surface conditions, such as ice cover, surface temperature, evaporation and water level, respond dramatically to this threat, as observed in recent decades. In this Review, we discuss physical lake variables and their responses to climate change. Decreases in winter ice cover and increases in lake surface temperature modify lake mixing regimes and accelerate lake evaporation. Where not balanced by increased mean precipitation or inflow, higher evaporation rates will favour a decrease in lake level and surface water extent. Together with increases in extreme-precipitation events, these lake responses will impact lake ecosystems, changing water quantity and quality, food provisioning, recreational opportunities and transportation. Future research opportunities, including enhanced observation of lake variables from space (particularly for small water bodies), improved in situ lake monitoring and the development of advanced modelling techniques to predict lake processes, will improve our global understanding of lake responses to a changing climate. ✉},

abstract = {Interconversion of various measures of zooplankton biomass have great utility in studies requiring nondestructive techniques, or for interpretation of past data. In establishing predictive relationships between such measures, the appropriate regression to use is the geometric mean estimate, which provides a regression line in which the regressions of X on Yand Yon X are identical. We have employed this type of analysis in determinations on samples from diverse sea areas in different seasons and have determined that statistically significant relationships exist between carbon, wet weight, displacement volume, and dry weight when a constant technique is used. The slope of the regression line for log transformed values for carbon vs. dry weight and wet weight vs. displacement volume was sufficiently close to unity to assume a straight percentage conversion between these values. Carbon was 31-33{\%} of dry weight and wet weight was 72-73{\%} of displacement volume, according to our techniques. Comparability of different techniques for a biomass measurement may be poor, especially in the case of displacement volume and wet weight measurements due to variations in the interstitial water content. Moreover, interstitial water content varies inversely with total biomass density, which accounts for the absence of a simple percentage relationship between wet weight or displacement volume and other measures of zooplankton biomass.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phytoplankton communities are often used as a marker for the determination of fresh water quality. The routine analysis, however, is very time consuming and expensive as it is carried out manually by trained personnel. The goal of this work is to develop a system for an automated analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A novel open source system for the automated recognition of phytoplankton by the use of microscopy and image analysis was developed. It integrates the segmentation of the organisms from the background, the calculation of a large range of features, and a neural network for the classification of imaged organisms into different groups of plankton taxa. The analysis of samples containing 10 different taxa showed an average recognition rate of 94.7{\%} and an average error rate of 5.5{\%}. The presented system has a flexible framework which easily allows expanding it to include additional taxa in the future.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The implemented automated microscopy and the new open source image analysis system--PlanktoVision--showed classification results that were comparable or better than existing systems and the exclusion of non-plankton particles could be greatly improved. The software package is published as free software and is available to anyone to help make the analysis of water quality more reproducible and cost effective.},

Biomass spectra were defined for individual sizes ranging from 128 to 30 x lu6 /tin3 (nano- to mesozooplanlcton) through the image analysis of plankton samples. The winter biomass spectrum is perturbed by sharp fluctuations in those size classes which correspond to the so-called net-plankton, but there is not a direct propagation of the instability to larger size classes. We hypothesize an indirect biomass flow through a dctrital compartment which could be used by the omnivorous zooplankton. The existence of 'bottleneclcs' in the flow of energy within a formal biomass spectrum makes it necessary to combine this approach with the construction of a dctrital compart- ment, at least for the particular case of coastal waters.},

abstract = {Environmental context Despite being present at trace concentrations, arsenic and phosphorus are among the most important of freshwater contaminants. This research highlights the biogeochemical coupling of both elements in a New Zealand lake. We find that the mineralisation of organic residues coupled to the dissolution of colloidal iron and manganese hydroxides may be an important driver of the bioavailability of phosphorus and arsenic. Abstract Seasonal stratification in temperate lakes greater than a few metres deep provides conditions amenable to pronounced vertical zonation of redox chemistry. Such changes are particularly evident in eutrophic systems where high phytoplankton biomass often leads to seasonally established anaerobic hypolimnia and profound changes in geochemical conditions. In this study, we investigated the behaviour of trace elements in the water column of a seasonally stratified, eutrophic lake. Two consecutive years of data from Lake Ngapouri, North Island, New Zealand, demonstrate the occurrence of highly correlated profiles of phosphorus, arsenic, iron and manganese, all of which increased in concentration by 1–2 orders of magnitude within the anaerobic hypolimnion. Stoichiometric and mass-balance considerations demonstrate that increases in alkalinity in hypolimnetic waters were consistent with observed changes in sulfate, Fe and Mn concentrations with depth, corresponding to dissimilatory reduction of sulfate, FeIII and MnIV hydroxides. Thermodynamic constraints on Fe, Mn and Al solubility indicate that amorphous FeIII, MnIV hydroxides most probably controlled Fe and Mn in the surface mixed layer ({\~{}}0 to 8m) whereas AlIII hydroxides were supersaturated throughout the entire system. Surface complexation modelling indicated that iron hydroxides (HFO) potentially dominated As speciation in the lake. It is likely that other colloidal phases such as allophanic clays also limited HPO42– activity, reducing competition for HAsO42– adsorption to iron hydroxides. This research highlights the coupling of P, As, Fe and Mn in Lake Ngapouri, and the apparent role of multiple colloidal phases in affecting P and As activity within overarching microbiological and geochemical processes.},

abstract = {Reservoirs are key components of water infrastructure that serve many functions (water supply, hydropower generation, flood control, recreation, ecosystem services, etc.). Climate change affects the hydrology of the tributary areas to reservoirs, which may profoundly impact their operation and possibly the reservoirs' water quality, among which the temperature gradient and the total dissolved solids (TDS) are key qualitative characteristics of reservoirs, especially those with irrigation function. This study examines water-quality changes in the Aidoghmoush reservoir (East Azerbaijan-Iran) under climate-change conditions in the period 2026–2039. The temperature and precipitation climate variables are calculated by the HadCM3 model driven by emission scenario A2 in the baseline period (1987–2000), and these variables are then projected over the future period (2026–2039). The average annual runoff under climate-change conditions is simulated by the IHACRES model. The results show the future average annual runoff would decrease by about 1{\%} compared to the baseline conditions. The CE-QUAL-W2 model is employed to simulate the reservoir water quality. It is predicted the surface air temperature would increase by 1.3 °C under the climate-change scenario compared to the baseline condition, and the temperatures of the reservoir's surface- and bottom-waters would increase by 1.19 and 1.24 °C, respectively. The average TDS near the reservoir surface would increase by 44.5 g/m 3 (4.3{\%}) relative to baseline TDS. The TDS near the reservoir surface are projected to be highest in autumn and winter for baseline and future conditions. This research shows that changes due to climate change are potentially severe, and presents a methodology that could assist managers and planners to find optimal strategies of reservoir operation to cope with changes in thermal stratification and TDS. This paper results identify the reservoir levels from which to withdraw water with the best water-quality characteristics.},

Under ongoing climate change and increasing anthropogenic activity, which continuously challenge ecosystem resilience, an in-depth understanding of ecological processes is urgently needed. Lakes, as providers of numerous ecosystem services, face multiple stressors that threaten their functioning. Harmful cyanobacterial blooms are a persistent problem resulting from nutrient pollution and climate-change induced stressors, like poor transparency, increased water temperature and enhanced stratification. Consistency in data collection and analysis methods is necessary to achieve fully comparable datasets and for statistical validity, avoiding issues linked to disparate data sources. The European Multi Lake Survey (EMLS) in summer 2015 was an initiative among scientists from 27 countries to collect and analyse lake physical, chemical and biological variables in a fully standardized manner. This database includes in-situ lake variables along with nutrient, pigment and cyanotoxin data of 369 lakes in Europe, which were centrally analysed in dedicated laboratories. Publishing the EMLS methods and dataset might inspire similar initiatives to study across large geographic areas that will contribute to better understanding lake responses in a changing environment.},

This paper reviews the recent progress in assessing the physiological state of phytoplankton with flow cytometry by inherent cell properties such as cell size and chlorophyll autofluorescence, specific fluorescent dyes, and newly developed molecular probes and enzyme substrates. It is reported how nitrogen and iron limitation as well as the effect of copper pollution could be derived from changes in cell inherent properties. Effects of Cu were also recorded by monitoring cell membrane potentials and esterase activity. Photosynthetic capacity of algae was assessed by changes in chlorophyll fluorescence with the electron transport inhibitor DCMU, by a cytometric adaptation of the pump-and-probe approach, and molecular probes for Rubisco. Antibodies were also applied to mark non-terminal stages in the cell DNA replication cycle, to detect non-proliferating cells, to assess DNA damage caused by UV-B radiation and to quantify diatom stickiness. Fluorescein diacetate proved useful to discriminate metabolically active from inactive cells and to reveal strategies of dark survival in algae. The activity of alkaline phosphatase was recorded by a new fluorigenic substrate ELF, and polyclonal antibodies against nitrate reductase (NR) provided measurements of the NR abundance. An outlook will show how recent developments in molecular probes might affect the future analysis of marine ecosystems and their communities.},

abstract = {The distribution of biomass among phytoplankton and free-living invertebrates was analysed in a shallow Mediterranean salt marsh submitted to fluctuating water level. Among phytoplankton, biomass accumulated in sizes dominated by mixotrophic species, indicating a competitive advantage for these species, which also prey on other smaller primary producers. Among invertebrates, biomass accumulated in the larger sizes, corresponding to species which partially exploit other nearby systems, such as the aerial environment (insects), or to those able to exploit particulated organic matter in marsh-bed sediment (amphipods). Biomass distribution models developed for pelagic systems are dis- cussed in relation to fluctuating temporary waters. The integrated spectrum approximated (r2 = 0.96) a Pareto distribution with a slope of c = 1.38. Intense disturbances caused a decrease in r2 and an increase in c. Under stable conditions, two different tendencies were observed, depending on the degree of eutrophy of the basins: higher values of c were measured in the more eutrophic basins, and lower values in the less eutrophic ones. We hypothesize that highly irregular nutrient input could explain these differences.},

abstract = {Droughts lead to falling river water levels and consequently expose river sediments. It is well known that from these exposed aquatic sediments, CO2 emits to the atmosphere, but upscaling of CO2 measurements from discrete point measurements to an entire river system remains challenging. Naturally occurring heterogeneous processes must be accounted for to obtain an overall CO2 flux and to assess its significance. We contribute to this challenge by incorporating a two stage scaling approach using in situ CO2 fluxes and remote sensing data. First, by combining optical airborne data with closed chamber measurements at a representative model site during a first scaling stage, we derive land cover type specific CO2 fluxes and identify distance to the water as the most suitable proxy for further upscaling. Second, we upscale derived spatial relations from the first scaling stage to the entire river system of the Elbe River using a satellite-based analysis. In this way, we derived area-weighted CO2 emissions from exposed river sediments of 56.6 ± 64.8 tC day−1 (corrected distance proxy) and 52.9 ± 44.6 tC day−1 (land cover proxy), respectively, for 1 day during the 2018 extreme drought. Given the intensification of droughts in terms of length and reoccurrence frequency, this result not only highlights the importance of drought-induced exposition of river sediment as a source of atmospheric CO2 but also underscores the ability to monitor CO2 emissions over an entire river system on a regular basis using remote sensing.},

abstract = {Inland waters were recently recognized to be important sources of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, and including inland water emissions in large scale greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets may potentially offset the estimated carbon sink in many areas. However, the lack of GHG flux measurements and well-defined inland water areas for extrapolation, make the magnitude of the potential offset unclear. This study presents coordinated flux measurements of CH4 and CO2 in multiple lakes, ponds, rivers, open wells, reservoirs, springs, and canals in India. All these inland water types, representative of common aquatic ecosystems in India, emitted substantial amounts of CH4 and a major fraction also emitted CO2. The total CH4 flux (including ebullition and diffusion) from all the 45 systems ranged from 0.01 to 52.1 mmol m-2 d-1, with a mean of 7.8 ± 12.7 (mean ± 1 SD) mmol m-2 d-1. The mean surface water CH4 concentration was 3.8 ± 14.5 $\mu$m (range 0.03-92.1 $\mu$m). The CO2 fluxes ranged from -28.2 to 262.4 mmol m-2 d-1 and the mean flux was 51.9 ± 71.1 mmol m-2 d-1. The mean partial pressure of CO2 was 2927 ± 3269 $\mu$atm (range: 400-11 467 $\mu$atm). Conservative extrapolation to whole India, considering the specific area of the different water types studied, yielded average emissions of 2.1 Tg CH4 yr-1 and 22.0 Tg CO2 yr-1 from India's inland waters. When expressed as CO2 equivalents, this amounts to 75 Tg CO2 equivalents yr-1 (53-98 Tg CO2 equivalents yr-1; ± 1 SD), with CH4 contributing 71{\%}. Hence, average inland water GHG emissions, which were not previously considered, correspond to 42{\%} (30-55{\%}) of the estimated land carbon sink of India. Thereby this study illustrates the importance of considering inland water GHG exchange in large scale assessments.},

abstract = {Simultaneous measurements of inorganic carbon fixation and phagotrophic particle uptake by Dinobryon in a metalimnetic algal abundance peak showed that this alga depended more strongly on ingested bacteria for nutrition than on photosynthesis. Measurements of the grazing rate at different depths in Lac Gilbert, Quebec, showed that the particle ingestion rate depends on water temperature rather than light availability. Phagocytosis of bacteria proceeded at a similar rate both day and night in most lakes where Dinobryon was found. Since other chrysomonad genera (Chrysophaerella, Uroglena, Catenochrysis, Ochromonas, Chromulina, and Chrysococcus) were also found to ingest particles, it will not be possible to estimate grazing on bacteria by counting nonpigmented cells and ignoring those containing chlorophyll. In oligotrophic Lac Bowker, 30{\%} of the phytoplankton cells were actively ingesting small particles, and it was these phytoplankton and not the less numerous zooplankton that were responsible for most bacterial grazing in the lake. Phagotrophy by algae appears to be an important but unexpected pathway for energy flow in lakes. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1987 American Society of Limnology and Oceanography},

abstract = {Variability of CO2 concentrations within the Earth system occurs over a wide range of time and spatial scales. Resolving this variability and its drivers in terrestrial and aquatic environments ultimately requires high-resolution spatial and temporal monitoring; however, relatively high-cost gas analyzers and data loggers can present barriers in terms of cost and functionality. To overcome these barriers, we developed a low-cost Arduino monitoring platform (CO2-LAMP) for recording CO2 variability in electronically harsh conditions: humid air, soil, and aquatic environments. A relatively inexpensive CO2 gas analyzer was waterproofed using a semi-permeable, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane. Using first principles, we derived a formulation of the theoretical operation and measurement of PCO2(aq) by infrared gas analyzers submerged in aquatic environments. This analysis revealed that an IRGA should be able to measure PCO2(aq) independent of corrections for hydrostatic pressure. CO2-LAMP theoretical operation and measurement were also verified by accompanying laboratory assessment measuring PCO2(aq) at multiple water depths. The monitoring platform was also deployed at two sites within the Springfield Plateau province in northwest Arkansas, USA: Blowing Springs Cave and the Savoy Experimental Watershed. At Blowing Springs Cave, the CO2-LAMP operated alongside a relatively greater-cost CO2 monitoring platform. Over the monitoring period, measured values between the two systems covaried linearly (r2 = 0.97 and 0.99 for cave air and cave stream dissolved CO2, respectively). At the Savoy Experimental Watershed, measured soil CO2 variability capturing sub-daily variation was consistent with previously documented studies in humid, temperate soils. Daily median values varied linearly with soil moisture content (r2 = 0.84). Overall, the CO2-LAMP captured sub-daily variability of CO2 in humid air, soil, and aquatic environments that, while out of the scope of the study, highlight both cyclical and complex CO2 behavior. At present, long-term assessment of platform design is ongoing. Considering cost-savings, CO2-LAMP presents a working base design for continuous, accurate, low-power, and low-cost CO2 monitoring for remote locations.},

abstract = {Net methane fluxes as well as methane fluxes via gas bubbles and via molecular diffusion were measured separately at nine different sampling sites throughout a beaver pond located in the low boreal forest region of central Ontario, Canada. In 1990, the average daily methane emission rate was 37.2 ± 30.4 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, yielding a total annual methane efflux of 5.8 g CH4 m-2 of which 1.1 g CH4 m-2 were produced in the wintertime when the pond was ice covered. On average, 65{\%} of the net methane flux was released via gas bubble emission, the remaining 35{\%} via molecular diffusion. Gas bubble flux rates were highly variable in space and time, suggesting that low sampling frequences, common in many methane emission studies, could introduce large uncertainties to the estimated annual flux rates for different wetland systems. The effects of changes in environmental variables on methane emissions were found to be strongly dependent on which transport mechanism dominated the release of methane from the sediments. While the gas bubble flux volume was mainly affected by changes in atmospheric pressure and sediment temperatures, the diffusive flux component was found to be more sensitive to changes in the pond water level. Overall, magnitudes of methane fluxes from this pond were similar to other beaver ponds and moderate to high when compared to other wetland types in the low boreal forest region.},

Description of extreme processes in both intensity and frequency give a different and complementary overview of extreme events changes in future climate conditions for any of the magnitudes analyzed. In fact, a common feature obtained from the results is the absence of correlation between both magnitudes, as much as for temperatures as for precipitation.

Phytoplankters and bacteria together accounted for 72 to 85 {\%} of Re and zooplankters for the remainder Phytoplankters respired a large proportion (ca 30{\%}) of their gross production and were apparently mainly grazed by benthic suspension feeders. Phytoplankters dominated pelagic respiration (50{\%} of Re) at Stn 1, which has most phytoplankton, while bacteria dominated (44 {\%} of Re) at Stn 2. We ascribe the relatively larger respiratory activity of bacteria at Stn 2 to additional supply of organic matter from littoral plant communities and frequent sediment resuspension. The importance of bacteria in the pelagic food web was supported by other findings. Bacterial biomass approached phytoplankton carbon biomass at Stn 2 and bacterial net production in the water column was 10 {\%} (Stn 1) and 35 " {\%} (Stn 2) of phytoplankton gross production. Bacterial net production and respiration were linearly related in the bacterial size-fraction ({\textless} 1 pm) with a bacterial growth yield of 47 {\%}.

The equivalent electron and carbon flow of the reactions were also calculated to obtain a mass balance within the hypolimnia of UML. From the calculations, the approximate organic carbon decomposition rate, measured as CO$\backslash$2082 accumulation, was 7.54 mmol m$\backslash$207B² d$\backslash$207B¹. The amount of decomposition from the reactions involving nitrate, sulfate, iron and methane formation together accounted for 80{\%} of the total organic carbon decomposition. Therefore, 20{\%} of the CO$\backslash$2082 accumulation in UML could not be accounted for. Possible explanations for the excess CO$\backslash$2082 production could be the formation of reduced iron minerals and/or the loss of methane due to ebullition and oxidation. Such explanations suggest future studies of UML to better resolve the electron budget. In order to study the redox balance in Upper Mystic Lake, a method was devised for precisely sampling dissolved gases in the water column. Like other stratified lakes, UML has a large amount of anaerobic metabolism of organic matter occurring in the sediments and a subsequent accumulation of methane (CH$\backslash$2084) and carbon dioxide (CO$\backslash$2082) in the hypolimnia. Previously, limnological sampling for dissolved gases involved filling glass bottles with water pumped from depth using a peristaltic pump; however, such methods introduce the potential for gas exchange with the atmosphere. Therefore, there was a need for a dissolved gas sampler that could be used to obtain samples at precise depth intervals while at the same time isolating the samples from outside influences.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Insight into how environmental change determines the production and distribution of cyanobacterial toxins is necessary for risk assessment. Management guidelines currently focus on hepatotoxins (microcystins). Increasing attention is given to other classes, such as neurotoxins (e.g., anatoxin-a) and cytotoxins (e.g., cylindrospermopsin) due to their potency. Most studies examine the relationship between individual toxin variants and environmental factors, such as nutrients, temperature and light. In summer 2015, we collected samples across Europe to investigate the effect of nutrient and temperature gradients on the variability of toxin production at a continental scale. Direct and indirect effects of temperature were the main drivers of the spatial distribution in the toxins produced by the cyanobacterial community, the toxin concentrations and toxin quota. Generalized linear models showed that a Toxin Diversity Index (TDI) increased with latitude, while it decreased with water stability. Increases in TDI were explained through a significant increase in toxin variants such as MC-YR, anatoxin and cylindrospermopsin, accompanied by a decreasing presence of MC-LR. While global warming continues, the direct and indirect effects of increased lake temperatures will drive changes in the distribution of cyanobacterial toxins in Europe, potentially promoting selection of a few highly toxic species or strains.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Thermokarst lakes in the Arctic and Subarctic release carbon from thawing permafrost in the form of methane and carbon dioxide with important implications for regional and global carbon cycles. Lake ice impedes the release of gas during the winter. For instance, bubbles released from lake sediments become trapped in downward growing lake ice, resulting in vertically-oriented bubble columns in the ice that are visible on the lake surface. We here describe a classification technique using an object-based image analysis (OBIA) framework to successfully map ebullition bubbles in airborne imagery of early winter ice on an interior Alaska thermokarst lake. Ebullition bubbles appear as white patches in high-resolution optical remote sensing images of snow-free lake ice acquired in early winter and, thus, can be mapped across whole lake areas. We used high-resolution (9–11 cm) aerial images acquired two and four days following freeze-up in the years 2011 and 2012, respectively. The design of multiresolution segmentation and region-specific classification rulesets allowed the identification of bubble features and separation from other confounding factors such as snow, submerged and floating vegetation, shadows, and open water. The OBIA technique had an accuracy of {\textgreater}95{\%} for mapping ebullition bubble patches in early winter lake ice. Overall, we mapped 1195 and 1860 ebullition bubble patches in the 2011 and 2012 images, respectively. The percent surface area of lake ice covered with ebullition bubble patches for 2011 was 2.14{\%} and for 2012 was 2.67{\%}, representing a conservative whole lake estimate of bubble patches compared to ground surveys usually conducted on thicker ice 10 or more days after freeze-up. Our findings suggest that the information derived from high-resolution optical images of lake ice can supplement spatially limited field sampling methods to better estimate methane flux from individual lakes. The method can also be used to improve estimates of methane ebullition from numerous lakes within larger regions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Soils act as sources and sinks for greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Since both storage and emission capacities may be large, precise quantifications are needed to obtain reliable global budgets that are necessary for land-use management (agriculture, forestry), global change and for climate research. This paper discusses exclusively the soil emission-related processes and their influencing parameters. It reviews soil emission studies involving the most important land-cover types and climate zones and introduces important measuring systems for soil emissions. It addresses current shortcomings and the obvious bias towards northern hemispheric data. When using a conservative average of 300 mg CO 2 e m −2 h −1 (based on our literature review), this leads to global annual net soil emissions of ≥350 Pg CO 2 e (CO 2 e = CO 2 equivalents = total effect of all GHG normalized to CO 2). This corresponds to roughly 21{\%} of the global soil C and N pools. For comparison, 33.4 Pg CO 2 are being emitted annually by fossil fuel combustion and the cement industry.},

Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to establish patterns in species distribution, abundance, and biomass; and to determine the influence of site and season on the subtidal macrobenthic community. A total of 10 1 macrobenthic taxa were identified and values of diversity were generally low indicating a high degree of dominance of few species. Average abundance and biomass per site ranged from 46.7 to 8060 ind. m(-2) and 0.56 to 28.96 g AFDW m(-2), respectively. Abra alba was most abundant and had the highest biomass. Multivariate analysis revealed four distinct groups. Each group was represented by a specific species composition and characterised by different environmental conditions, in particular, the sediment characteristics and salinity. Abundance/biomass comparison (ABC) indicated that the lower part of the estuary is under environmental stress and is dominated by opportunistic species. The subtidal macrobenthic community of the lower Lima estuary differed between sites but not between seasons of the year.},

abstract = {CHEMTAX was used to assess the relative contribution of the main phytoplankton classes to the total concentration of Chlorophyll a (Chl a) from the waters off SW coast of Portugal. Sampling campaigns were carried out during all seasons from 2008 to 2012, at three stations located 2, 10 and 18 km from the coast. Samples were taken from the surface, mid-Secchi and Secchi depth, for the determination of Chl a and other phytoplanktonic pigments by HPLC. Supporting data were also obtained including dissolved inorganic nutrients, salinity, transparency, temperature and upwelling indices. The CHEMTAX results were also related to microscopy counts and also spectral analysis of absorption of other samples from the same sampling campaigns. The pigment results showed that diatoms dominated from early spring to summer, coinciding with upwelling conditions, while cryptophytes, prymnesiophytes and prasinophytes dominated in autumn and winter, coinciding with seasonal stratification. Although the contribution of cyanobacteria to total Chl a was generally low, there were occasional sampling campaigns where it was exceptionally high, but these appeared not to be related to upwelling. Dinoflagellates and chrysophytes were minority groups although the pigment marker peridinin that was used to distinguish dinoflagellates was not adequate for distinguishing all the members of this group. CHEMTAX was particularly useful for discriminating between the smaller (0–20 $\mu$m) classes of the microplankton that could not be easily identified by microscopy.},

abstract = {The patterns of variability of the size structure and functional composition of phytoplankton are closely linked to physical gradients in the coastal waters of the Gerlache Strait (Antarctic Peninsula). Different stratified conditions are found at both extremes of the Strait, separated by a large, rather vertically homogeneous body of water. In the SW extreme close to Bellingshausen Sea, a cold upper layer representative of ice melting influence is dominated by microplankton (20-100 ??m ESD) biomass, mainly composed of colonies or aggregates of Phaeocystis in bloom stage. In the NE extreme close to Bransfield Strait, a warm surface layer has a 10-20 ??m nano planktonic community dominated by Cryptomonas and a diverse assemblage of ultraplanktonic (2-10 ??m) flagellates. In this area, microplankton larger than 40 ??m ESD is almost absent at the sample volume studied. Also in terms of biomass, mixed central waters are dominated by microplankton, particularly large diatoms. Our results show that diatoms and microplankton are the dominant categories under turbulent conditions, with typical flagellate blooms (Phaeocystis and Cryptomonas) under particularly stratified conditions. In terms of numerical abundance, however, ultraplanktonic flagellates usually dominate the community, giving a bell shaped size-abundance spectra in all the regions and supporting previous suggestions of flagellate dominance even under mixed-layer conditions. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Methane emission pathways and their importance were quantified during a yearlong survey of a temperate hydropower reservoir. Measurements using gas traps indicated very high ebullition rates, but due to the stochastic nature of ebullition a mass balance approach was crucial to deduce system-wide methane sources and losses. Methane diffusion from the sediment was generally low and seasonally stable and did not account for the high concentration of dissolved methane measured in the reservoir discharge. A strong positive correlation between water temperature and the observed dissolved methane concentration enabled us to quantify the dissolved methane addition from bubble dissolution using a system-wide mass balance. Finally, knowing the contribution due to bubble dissolution, we used a bubble model to estimate bubble emission directly to the atmosphere. Our results indicated that the total methane emission from Lake Wohlen was on average {\textgreater}150 mg CH4 m-2 d -1, which is the highest ever documented for a midlatitude reservoir. The substantial temperature-dependent methane emissions discovered in this 90-year-old reservoir indicate that temperate water bodies can be an important but overlooked methane source. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We examined temperature trends in a 20-year set of monitoring records collected at multiple deep-water stations in the central basin of Lake Erie. Data collected were statistically corrected ("deseasonalized") to remove biases resulting from irregular sampling intervals within years. Depth-integrated summer temperature has increased by an average (±SE) of 0.037 ± 0.01 °C per year. An observed reduction of Secchi depth (SD) by 7 ± 3 cm/y seems to be unrelated to variation in either total phosphorus (TP) or chlorophyll a concentrations. Midsummer midbasin SD values varied widely between 4 and 10 m, possibly depending on whether phytoplankton were concentrated in the epilimnion (giving shallow SD), or whether phytoplankton had settled out of the epilimnion into the lower layers, giving deeper SD values. Hypolimnetic volume-corrected oxygen depletion (HVOD) rates have also been highly variable, ranging from 2.68 to 4.72 mg/L/mo. These rates are sensitive to production of oxygen in the thermocline and hypolimnion by photosynthetically active phytoplankton that have settled from the epilimnion. The HVOD rate in any year was correlated with the previous year's TP loading into Lake Erie. Since TP loading trends largely reflect the consequences of improving water treatment through the 1980s and increasing contributions from tributary run-off sediments through the 1990s, there is little direct evidence to suggest that the appearance of dreissenids has directly influenced hypolimnial oxygen depletion rates in the central basin. The observation that central-basin HVOD tracked the reductions in TP loadings through the 1980s may be the first affirmation that central basin hypolimnetic oxygen dynamics can be regulated by phosphorus inputs. This implies that TP loads must continue to be regulated if we wish to minimize oxygen depletion rates as a strategy to reduce the frequency of episodic central basin anoxia.},

abstract = {Freshwater reservoirs are a significant source of CO2 to the atmosphere. CO2 is known to be emitted at the reservoir surface by diffusion at the air-water interface and downstream of dams or powerhouses by degassing and along the river course. In this study, we quantified total CO2 emissions from the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir (Lao PDR) in the Mekong River watershed. The study started in May 2009, less than a year after flooding and just a few months after the maximum level was first reached and lasted until the end of 2013. We tested the hypothesis that soils from the drawdown area would be a significant contributor to the total CO2 emissions. Total inorganic carbon, dissolved and particulate organic carbon and CO2 concentrations were measured in 4 pristine rivers of the Nam Theun watershed, at 9 stations in the reservoir (vertical profiles) and at 16 stations downstream of the monomictic reservoir on a weekly to monthly basis. CO2 bubbling was estimated during five field campaigns between 2009 and 2011 and on a weekly monitoring, covering water depths ranging from 0.4 to 16m and various types of flooded ecosystems in 2012 and 2013. Three field campaigns in 2010, 2011 and 2013 were dedicated to the soils description in 21 plots and the quantification of soil CO2 emissions from the drawdown area. On this basis, we calculated total CO2 emissions from the reservoir and carbon inputs from the tributaries. We confirm the importance of the flooded stock of organic matter as a source of carbon (C) fuelling emissions. We show that the drawdown area contributes, depending on the year, from 40 to 75{\%} of total annual gross emissions in this flat and shallow reservoir. Since the CO2 emissions from the drawdown zone are almost constant throughout the years, the large interannual variations result from the significant decrease in diffusive fluxes and downstream emissions between 2010 and 2013. This overlooked pathway in terms of gross emissions would require an in-depth evaluation for the soil organic matter and vegetation dynamics to evaluate the actual contribution of this area in terms of net modification of gas exchange in the footprint of the reservoir, and how it could evolve in the future.},

abstract = {A new method of respiration rate measurement based on oxygen luminescence quenching in sensor spots was evaluated for the first time for aquatic bacterial communities. The commonly used Winkler and Clark electrode methods to quantify oxygen concentration both require long incubation times, and the latter additionally causes signal drift due to oxygen consumption at the cathode. The sensor spots proved to be advantageous over those methods in terms of precise and quick oxygen measurements in natural bacterial communities, guaranteeing a respiration rate estimate during a time interval short enough to neglect variations in organism composition, abundance, and activity. Furthermore, no signal drift occurs during measurements, and respiration rate measurements are reliable even at low temperatures and low oxygen consumption rates. Both a natural bacterioplankton sample and a bacterial isolate from a eutrophic river were evaluated in order to optimize the new method for aquatic microorganisms. A minimum abundance of 2.2 x 10(6) respiring cells ml(-1) of a bacterial isolate was sufficient to obtain a distinct oxygen depletion signal within 20 min at 20 degrees C with the new oxygen sensor spot method. Thus, a culture of a bacterial isolate from a eutrophic river (OW 144; 20 x 10(6) respiring bacteria ml(-1)) decreased the oxygen saturation about 8{\%} within 20 min. The natural bacterioplankton sample respired 2.8{\%} from initially 94{\%} oxygen-saturated water in 30 min. During the growth season in 2005, the planktonic community of a eutrophic river consumed between 0.7 and 15.6 micromol O(2) liter(-1) h(-1). The contribution of bacterial respiration to the total plankton community oxygen consumption varied seasonally between 11 and 100{\%}.},

abstract = {In ecosystems both production per unit biomass and biomass per unit area are functions of the individual body size of the organisms. Comparison of the properties of body-size spectra based on these two functions leads to their interpretation in energetics terms as reflections of three underlying mechanisms: the metabolic energy requirements of individuals, their aggregate food consumption, and the consequent dependence of organism number density on body size. The mean level of biomass observed over the whole body-size-range reflects the energy levels in particular ecosystems, while the succession of domes within the biomass spectrum expresses the trophic organization. Different shapes of these domes in different ecosystems may reflect the specific character of the predator-prey interactions in them.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: This study was aimed at identifying macroecological patterns in the relationship between phytoplankton cell size, abundance and metabolism in 2 marine ecosystems characterised by marked differences in resource availability and water-column stability. Several patterns emerged: (1) nearly isometric size-scaling of phytoplankton carbon fixation rate was described for both open-ocean and coastal ecosystems (mean slope: 1.17 and 0.90, respectively), supporting the idea that biomass-specific photosynthesis rates are largely independent of cell size; (2) less steep values for the size-scaling of abundance (mean slope: -0.73) were found in the coastal ecosystem compared to the open ocean (mean slope: -1.15); (3) large phytoplankton used more photosynthetic energy than smaller cells in the coastal ecosystem, but a constant flow of energy along the size spectrum was found in the open ocean; and (4) phytoplankton biomass turnover rates were 1 order of magnitude higher in the coastal ecosystem than in the open ocean, implying physiological limitation of phytoplankton growth in the oligotrophic ocean. Bottom-up and top-down mechanisms and their interaction with nutrient supply dynamics were suggested as major factors determining the contrasting phytoplankton size abundance distributions observed in coastal and open-ocean waters.},

abstract = {Microbial activity is a fundamental component of oceanic nutrient cycles. Photosynthetic microbes, collectively termed phytoplankton, are responsible for the vast majority of primary production in marine waters. The availability of nutrients in the upper ocean frequently limits the activity and abundance of these organisms. Experimental data have revealed two broad regimes of phytoplankton nutrient limitation in the modern upper ocean. Nitrogen availability tends to limit productivity throughout much of the surface low-latitude ocean, where the supply of nutrients from the subsurface is relatively slow. In contrast, iron often limits productivity where subsurface nutrient supply is enhanced, including within the main oceanic upwelling regions of the Southern Ocean and the eastern equatorial Pacific. Phosphorus, vitamins and micronutrients other than iron may also (co-)limit marine phytoplankton. The spatial patterns and importance of co-limitation, however, remain unclear. Variability in the stoichiometries of nutrient supply and biological demand are key determinants of oceanic nutrient limitation. Deciphering the mechanisms that underpin this variability, and the consequences for marine microbes, will be a challenge. But such knowledge will be crucial for accurately predicting the consequences of ongoing anthropogenic perturbations to oceanic nutrient biogeochemistry.},

@article{Kolokotrones2010,
abstract = {For more than three-quarters of a century it has been assumed that basal metabolic rate increases as body mass raised to some power p. However, there is no broad consensus regarding the value of p: whereas many studies have asserted that p is 3/4 (refs 1-4; 'Kleiber's law'), some have argued that it is 2/3 (refs 5-7), and others have found that it varies depending on factors like environment and taxonomy. Here we show that the relationship between mass and metabolic rate has convex curvature on a logarithmic scale, and is therefore not a pure power law, even after accounting for body temperature. This finding has several consequences. First, it provides an explanation for the puzzling variability in estimates of p, settling a long-standing debate. Second, it constitutes a stringent test for theories of metabolic scaling. A widely debated model based on vascular system architecture fails this test, and we suggest modifications that could bring it into compliance with the observed curvature. Third, it raises the intriguing question of whether the scaling relation limits body size.},

We review similar relationships also appearing in the analysis of aquatic ecosystems (i.e. the biomass spectra) in the context of ecological invariant relationships (i.e. independent of size) such as the 'energetic equivalence rule' and the 'linear biomass hypothesis'. We also discuss some power-law distributions emerging in the analysis of numbers and fluctuations in ecological attributes as they point to regularities that are yet to be integrated with traditional scaling relationships and which we foresee as an exciting area of future research.},

Biomass spectra were defined for individual sizes ranging from 128 to 30 x lu6 /tin3 (nano- to mesozooplanlcton) through the image analysis of plankton samples. The winter biomass spectrum is perturbed by sharp fluctuations in those size classes which correspond to the so-called net-plankton, but there is not a direct propagation of the instability to larger size classes. We hypothesize an indirect biomass flow through a dctrital compartment which could be used by the omnivorous zooplankton. The existence of 'bottleneclcs' in the flow of energy within a formal biomass spectrum makes it necessary to combine this approach with the construction of a dctrital compart- ment, at least for the particular case of coastal waters.},

The size distribution of phytoplankton and the ratio of heterotrophic to autotrophic biomass (H/A ratio), indicating the balance between primary production and its consumption, were investigated in the lakes of different trophic status. The results revealed that microphytoplankton ({\textgreater}20 mu m) in mesotrophic Lake Biwa, and picophytoplankton ({\textless}2 mu m) or nanophytoplankton (2-20 mu m) in oligotrophic Lake Baikal, comprised the highest proportion of the total phytoplankton biomass. The H/A ratio was lower in Lake Biwa ({\textless}1.) than in Lake Baikal ({\textgreater}1). The low H/A ratio in Lake Biwa appeared to be the consequence of the lack of consumption of the more abundant microphytoplankton, which were inferior competitors in nutrient uptake under oligotrophic conditions but less vulnerable to grazing. As a result, unconsumed microphytoplankton accumulated in the water column, decreasing the H/A ratio in Lake Biwa. Our results showed that food web structure and energy flow in planktonic communities were greatly influenced by the size distribution of phytoplankton, in conjunction with bottom-up (nutrient uptake) and top-down (grazing) effects at the trophic level of primary producers.},

abstract = {The universal temperature dependence of metabolic rates has been used to predict how ocean biology will respond to ocean warming. Determining the temperature sensitivity of phytoplankton metabolism and growth is of special importance because this group of organisms is responsible for nearly half of global primary production, sustains most marine food webs, and contributes to regulate the exchange of CO2 between the ocean and the atmosphere. Phytoplankton growth rates increase with temperature under optimal growth conditions in the laboratory, but it is unclear whether the same degree of temperature dependence exists in nature, where resources are often limiting. Here we use concurrent measurements of phytoplankton biomass and carbon fixation rates in polar, temperate and tropical regions to determine the role of temperature and resource supply in controlling the large-scale variability of in situ metabolic rates. We identify a biogeographic pattern in phytoplankton metabolic rates, which increase from the oligotrophic subtropical gyres to temperate regions and then coastal waters. Variability in phytoplankton growth is driven by changes in resource supply and appears to be independent of seawater temperature. The lack of temperature sensitivity of realized phytoplankton growth is consistent with the limited applicability of Arrhenius enzymatic kinetics when substrate concentrations are low. Our results suggest that, due to widespread resource limitation in the ocean, the direct effect of sea surface warming upon phytoplankton growth and productivity may be smaller than anticipated.},

abstract = {Vertical patterns of phytoplankton biomass driven by phytoflagellate migration constitute a natural, short-term process with potentially important impacts on estuarine primary production and community composition. Although often considered well-mixed, phytoflagellate vertical migration patterns have been observed in shallow estuaries. We investigated vertical migration patterns in two shallow estuaries to determine how often and under what environmental conditions vertical migration patterns occurred, and to understand the potential impacts of vertical migration on phytoplankton composition and productivity. Vertical migration patterns were determined from circumannual records of decimeter-scale, semihourly, vertical profiles of chlorophyll fluorescence in two shallow, microtidal estuaries, the New River Estuary and Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina, USA. Observed migration patterns were compared with coincident measures of temperature, salinity, light, turbidity, nutrients, vertical stratification, and wind speed. A simple light × biomass model was used to estimate the influence of vertical migration patterns on total water column primary production. Collectively, between two sites in each estuary, diel vertical migration (DVM) patterns were detected on about half of the days. A secondary migration pattern reflecting a midday descent was also observed and was attributed to avoidance of intense midday surface irradiance. The likelihood of detectable DVM patterns increased under warmer conditions and lower incident irradiance, and at two of the stations was lessened by elevated wind speeds or reduced stratification intensity. Even weak stratification may be sufficient to reduce vertical mixing to levels that allow effective depth regulation by directed swimming. Modeled depth-integrated primary production was increased modestly ({\textless}10{\%}) by observed migration patterns compared to a hypothetical vertically-homogenous biomass distribution. Access to optimal light levels and elevated bottom water dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations provides selective advantages that may explain phytoflagellate dominance in these estuaries, particularly during the warmer months, when production in surface waters of both systems is strongly N-limited.},

Multivariate analysis revealed four distinct groups. Each group was represented by a specific species composition and characterised by different environmental conditions, in particular, the sediment characteristics and salinity. Abundance/biomass comparison (ABC) indicated that the lower part of the estuary is under environmental stress and is dominated by opportunistic species.

abstract = {In this paper we compared two different approaches to estimate plankton energy consumption: (i) combination of the observed biomass-size spectrum and empirical allometric relationships between respiration and body size, and (ii) the experimental measurement of ETS (electronic transfer system) activity. The first approach was carried out through both discrete and continuous models. Results indicated a good agreement between predicted and observed metabolism in both a freshwater and an oceanic plankton assemblage from bacteria to zooplankton. The discrete integration of the spectrum accounts better for changing systems than continuous integration, which is more appropriate for theoretical approaches to studying the metabolism of the community. The combination of biomass spectrum slopes and allometric exponents was critical in metabolism sensitivity to size structure: flatter biomass slopes (as found in microbial assemblages) allow for greater variations in this size range to the total metabolism contribution of the planktonic community. For future studies, the fast progression in technical discrimination and measurement of particles makes this approach a promising tool for the analysis of energy in planktonic ecosystems.},

Except in coastal waters the predominant organisms of the upper 500 m in the western North Atlantic and Southeast Pacific were generally $\mu$ flagellates (2–10 $\mu$). Most bacteria and many flagellates were associated with flocculent organic aggregates. Below 25–50 m most of the flagellates were non-pigmented. Evidence is presented that much of the energy fixed by photosynthesis is utilized by Protista. Organic aggregates appear to be the locus of much of the metabolic activity in the ocean.},

abstract = {Temperature and nutrient availability play key roles in controlling the pathways and rates at which energy and materials move through ecosystems. These factors have also changed dramatically on Earth over the past century as human activities have intensified. Although significant effort has been devoted to understanding the role of temperature and nutrients in isolation, less is known about how these two factors interact to influence ecological processes. Recent advances in ecological stoichiometry and metabolic ecology provide a useful framework for making progress in this area, but conceptual synthesis and review are needed to help catalyze additional research. Here, we examine known and potential interactions between temperature and nutrients from a variety of physiological, community, and ecosystem perspectives. We first review patterns at the level of the individual, focusing on four traits – growth, respiration, body size, and elemental content – that should theoretically govern how temperature and nutrients interact to influence higher levels of biological organization. We next explore the interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on populations, communities, and food webs by synthesizing information related to community size spectra, biomass distributions, and elemental composition. We use metabolic theory to make predictions about how population-level secondary production should respond to interactions between temperature and resource supply, setting up qualitative predictions about the flows of energy and materials through metazoan food webs. Last, we examine how temperature–nutrient interactions influence processes at the whole-ecosystem level, focusing on apparent vs. intrinsic activation energies of ecosystem processes, how to represent temperature–nutrient interactions in ecosystem models, and patterns with respect to nutrient uptake and organic matter decomposition. We conclude that a better understanding of interactions between temperature and nutrients will be critical for developing realistic predictions about ecological responses to multiple, simultaneous drivers of global change, including climate warming and elevated nutrient supply.},

abstract = {We tested if the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) correctly predicts plankton metabolism in a temperate lake, based on a long-term (about 15 years), high-frequency dataset of body size, abundance and production, using two different techniques: least squares regression and maximum likelihood. For phytoplankton, the general fit was relatively poor (r2? 0.53). The assumption of the MTE on temperature dependence of metabolism was not supported, and the assumed value of 3⁄4 of the allometric exponent was barely within 95{\%} confidence limits. For some of the models, the value of b was significantly higher than 3⁄4. When radiation was included as an additional predictor, it improved the model considerably (r2?0.67). Including grazing by zooplankton reduced the model residuals during the summer period, when grazing is a dominant factor. The allometric exponent had virtually no effect for phytoplankton, due to little variability in average individual size. Zooplankton production, on the other hand, was better predicted by MTE, showing stronger effects of temperature and body size, the average of which varied by a factor of more than a hundred. However, the best-fitting value of the allometric exponent for zooplankton was 0.85, and significantly higher than the 3⁄4 predicted by the theory. The ratio of observed production to biomass for the entire plankton community declined linearly with the body size (in log-log) with a slope corresponding to a value of b?0.85. We conclude that the MTE has little predictive power for the metabolism of lacustrine plankton, in particular for phytoplankton, and especially at the scale of variability of this study, and that this could be improved by incorporating radiation into the model.},

abstract = {Biomass size spectra were calculated from comprehensive microscopic assessment of plankton organisms in large, deep Lake Constance (Bodcnsec). They revealed an approximately constant size distribution of biomass from bacteria (10 I4 g C cell-‘) to crustaceans ( 1O-4 g C ind.-‘), resembling distributions found in open marine systems (seasonal average). Size ranges without detectable biomass as reported from other lakes did not exist. External perturbations, and size and depth of the pelagic zone, but not the type of habitat (marine vs. limnetic) were suggested as crucial factors influencing the shape of the biomass size distribution. The fit of the normalized biomass size spectrum to a straight line with a slope of - 1 .OO was very close (rZ = 0.98), indicating a decrease of abundance per size class N proportional to the increase of body weight w (N cc w-l). Seasonal variation of biomass per size class was strongly related to body weight. It was largest for organisms with generation times of about 1 yr. Slopes of normalized biomass size spectra were steep in early spring (- 1.16) indicating a dominance of small organisms and a low transfer cfficicncy to larger organisms. From spring to early summer, the size distribution of organisms shifted toward larger organisms (slope up to -0.94). The seasonal changes of the size spectra support the idea that, due to differences in the intrinsic reaction times of differently sized organisms, varying environmental conditions produce less regularly shaped actual size spectra, if not averaged over a period longer than the external fluctuations.},

abstract = {Interconversion of various measures of zooplankton biomass have great utility in studies requiring nondestructive techniques, or for interpretation of past data. In establishing predictive relationships between such measures, the appropriate regression to use is the geometric mean estimate, which provides a regression line in which the regressions of X on Yand Yon X are identical. We have employed this type of analysis in determinations on samples from diverse sea areas in different seasons and have determined that statistically significant relationships exist between carbon, wet weight, displacement volume, and dry weight when a constant technique is used. The slope of the regression line for log transformed values for carbon vs. dry weight and wet weight vs. displacement volume was sufficiently close to unity to assume a straight percentage conversion between these values. Carbon was 31-33{\%} of dry weight and wet weight was 72-73{\%} of displacement volume, according to our techniques. Comparability of different techniques for a biomass measurement may be poor, especially in the case of displacement volume and wet weight measurements due to variations in the interstitial water content. Moreover, interstitial water content varies inversely with total biomass density, which accounts for the absence of a simple percentage relationship between wet weight or displacement volume and other measures of zooplankton biomass.},

abstract = {Modelling the size-abundance spectrum of phytoplankton has proven to be a very useful tool for the analysis of physical-biological coupling and the vertical flux of carbon in oceanic ecosystems at different scales. A frequent observation relates high phytoplankton biovolume in productive regions with flatter spectrum slope and the opposite in oligotrophic ecosystems. Rather than this, the relationship between high biovolume phytoplankton assemblages and flatter size-abundance spectra does not correspond with measurements of the phytoplankton community in the Atlantic Ocean open waters. As part of the Malaspina Circunnavegation Expedition, sixty seven sampling stations within the Atlantic Ocean covering six oceanographic provinces, at different seasons, produced a complete set of phytoplankton size-spectra whose slope and biovolume did not show any obvious interrelation. In these oligotrophic sites, small (procaryotes) and medium-size (nanoplankton) cells are responsible for the most part of biovolume, and their response to environmental conditions does not apply to changes in the size-abundance spectrum slope as expected in richer, large-cell dominated ecosystems.},

abstract = {The usefulness and relevance of size-based indicators (SBIs) to an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) are assessed through a review of empirical and modelling studies. SBIs are tabulated along with their definitions, data requirements, potential biases, availability of time-series, and expected directions of change in response to fishing pressure. They include mean length in a population, mean length in a community, mean maximum length in a community, and the slope and intercept of size spectra. Most SBIs can be derived from fairly standard survey data on length frequencies, without the need for elaborate models. Possible fishing- and environment-induced effects are analysed to distinguish between the two causes, and hypothetical cases of reference directions of change are tabulated. We conclude that no single SBI can serve as an effective overall indicator of heavy fishing pressure. Rather, suites of SBI should be selected, and reference directions may be more useful than reference points. Further modelling and worldwide comparative studies are needed to provide better understanding of SBIs and the factors affecting them. The slow response to fishing pressure reflects the complexity of community interactions and ecosystem responses, and prohibits their application in the context of short-term (annual) tactical fisheries management. However, movement towards longer-term (5-10 years) strategic management in EAF should facilitate their use. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {The relationship between previously published values of "the intrinsic rate of natural increase" (rm) and body weight is studied. When organisms covering a wide range of body weights are compared, a correlation is found which can be described by the equation rm = a {\$}W{\^{}}{\{}n{\}}{\$} where rm is the intrinsic rate of natural increase per day and W is the average body weight in grams; a is a constant which takes three different values for unicellular organisms and heterotherm and homoiotherm animals respectively. The constant n has a value of about -0.275 for all three groups. This result is compared to the previously found relationship between the metabolic rate per unit weight and body size. It is shown that rm can be interpreted as the productivity of an exponentially growing population and thus must correlate with metabolic rate. The values of the constants a and n, however, show that for each of the three groups, unicellular organisms, heterotherms and homoiotherms the ratio of energy used for maintenance to that used for production increases with increasing body size and that the evolution from protozoa to metazoa and the evolution from heterotherm to homoiotherm animals in both cases resulted in not only an increased metabolic rate, as shown previously, but also in a decreased population growth efficiency. It is shown that the increase in reproductive potential of homoiotherms relative to that of heterotherms is due to a shorter prereproductive period in the former group. Previous estimates of rm for different species and comparisons between these values in relation to their ecology are discussed in context with the found "rm-body weight" relationship. Attempts to show that such comparisons will be more meaningful when body size is included in the considerations are made. It is suggested that the found relationship may represent the maximum values rm can take rather than average values for all species, since it is likely that the species used for laboratory population-studies are biased in favor of species with high reproductive potentials.},

abstract = {1. Picophytoplankton are planktonic photosynthetic O-2-evolvers that$\backslash$ncan pass through 2 mu m-diameter pores; they include prokaryotic$\backslash$n(eubacterial) and eukaryotic members and occur in freshwater and$\backslash$nmarine habitats. There are no photosynthetic reproductive and dispersal$\backslash$nstages of benthic macrophytes of picoplanktonic size. The picophytoplankton$\backslash$ncondition appears to be derived and polyphyletic in both prokaryotes$\backslash$nand eukaryotes. 2. Picophytoplankton are among the smallest free-living$\backslash$ncells, despite having to contain the photosynthetic apparatus, which$\backslash$noccupies about half of the cell volume, as well as core cellular$\backslash$nmachinery. The size of the smallest prokaryotic (0.6 mu m diameter)$\backslash$nand eukaryotic (0.95 mu m diameter) picophytoplankton are close to$\backslash$nthe minimum possible size estimated from the occurrence of non-scalable$\backslash$nessential components such as the genome and plasmalemma and other$\backslash$nmembranes. 3. Picophytoplankton cells have advantages relative to$\backslash$nlarger phytoplankton cells in terms of resource acquisition and the$\backslash$nsubsequent use of the resources in catalysing cell growth and reproduction.$\backslash$nThe smaller package effect in light harvesting means smaller resource$\backslash$n(energy, C, N, Fe, Mn, Cu) costs of photon harvesting and transformation$\backslash$ninto chemical energy in small than in large cells. The smaller diffusion$\backslash$nboundary layer around small cells, coupled with smaller nutrient$\backslash$nfluxes per unit plasmalemma area needed to attain a given fraction$\backslash$nof the maximum specific growth rate in smaller cells, increases the$\backslash$navailability of low concentrations of nutrients to small relative$\backslash$nto larger cells. If the supply of CO, to the core photosynthetic$\backslash$ncarboxylase ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase is purely$\backslash$nby diffusion then smaller cells could satisfy their catalytic requirements$\backslash$nwith less of this enzyme whose synthesis has high energy, C and N$\backslash$ncosts. Overall, resources can be acquired, and used in growth, more$\backslash$neffectively in smaller than in larger cells. 4. Some factors work$\backslash$nagainst the conclusion in (3.) but, in most habitats, do not negate$\backslash$nthese conclusions. Examples related to non-scalable essential cell$\backslash$ncomponents are the use of energy, C, N and P in the genome and of$\backslash$nenergy, C, N, P and Fe in the plasma membrane. Transport-related$\backslash$nfactors include the increased potential cell volume-specific leakage$\backslash$nof accumulated resources, and the greater cell volume-specific energy$\backslash$ncosts of motility at a given speed, in smaller than in larger cells.$\backslash$nThe smaller package effect in smaller cells involves a greater potential$\backslash$nfor photodamage by both photosynthetically active radiation and by$\backslash$nUV-B. 5. Picophytoplankton occurrence is also a function of factors$\backslash$nwhich lead to cell loss. Factors such as sinking out of the euphotic$\backslash$nzone and parasitism by eukaryotes such as chytrids are less significant$\backslash$nfor picophytoplankton than for larger cells, whereas viral parasitism$\backslash$nand grazing by appropriately sized grazers are likely to be at least$\backslash$nas great for picophytoplankton as for larger cells. 6. The totality$\backslash$nof the effects mentioned in (3.) above suggests that picophytoplankton$\backslash$nshould generally have higher specific growth rates (probably) in$\backslash$nresource-saturated (photons, C, N, P, Fe, etc.) and (certainly) in$\backslash$nresource-limited environments than do larger cells. The distribution$\backslash$nof picophytoplankton is certainly consistent with their ability to$\backslash$ncapitalize on resource-limited environments: they contribute a larger$\backslash$nfraction of biomass and productivity relative to larger cells in$\backslash$nlow-nutrient than in high-nutrient environments, and in low-light$\backslash$n(e.g. the deep chlorophyll maximum) than in high-light environments.$\backslash$n7. Sexual reproduction is apparently rare in picophytoplankton, with$\backslash$nimplications for species definition. There are probably relatively$\backslash$nfew species (hundreds or thousands) with very wide biogeographical$\backslash$nranges in marine or in freshwater habitats. The small size and (probably)$\backslash$nlow biodiversity means large numbers of individuals worldwide, e.g.$\backslash$nc.10(26) individuals of the commonest species of the marine cyanobacterium$\backslash$nSynechococcus. Picophytoplankton contribute at least one-tenth (i.e.$\backslash$nin excess of 3 Pg C per year) to global aquatic net primary productivity.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {In the summer of 1989 vertical profiles of chlorophyll a were taken in the North Atlantic. Stations were located along a transect following longitude 20-degrees-W, between 60 and 33-degrees-N. Maximum chlorophyll a levels were located near the surface in the north (2 mugl-1) but became gradually deeper towards the south (0.3 mug l-1 at a depth of 80-110m). Primary production varied only by a factor of 2.3 (226-533 mg C m-2 day-1), whereas the assimilation ratio showed far less variation (15.46 +/- 4.61 mg C mg Chl-1 day-1, n = 14). The northern part of the transect showed no thermal stratification, and nutrients were plentiful. Phytoplankton was distributed homogeneously, with a nearly constant signature of the cellular fluorescence characteristics as monitored by flow-cytometry. The dominant taxa were small prymnesiophytes (Emiliania huxleyi) and chroococcoid phycoerythrin-containing cyanobacteria. Cells were healthy, resulting in net growth rates (growth rate minus grazing) of up to 0.75 divisions per day. Of the total primary production, 68{\%} was actually converted into new plant carbon. Midway along the transect (47-degrees-N) there was a sharp thermocline at a depth of 35 m. All nutrients (nitrogen, phosphate and silicate) were depleted in the upper water layer. Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community in numbers varying from 12,000 to 39,000 cells ml-1. Stabilization of the water column was apparently in progress, as could be derived from the gradual increase in mean cellular red fluorescence of the cyanobacteria with depth. Furthermore, net growth rates of the algae were relatively low, as was the proportion of primary production resulting in an actual increase of plant carbon (42{\%}). At the southernmost station (33-degrees-N), the situation was typical of the oligotrophic subtropics: a sharp thermocline at 35 m, the 0.1{\%} surface incident irradiance level at 150 m, and a nitracline at a depth of 100-120m. The most prominent (pico)plankters present were prochlorophytes, predominantly at the deep chlorophyll maximum (80-100 m, up to 95,000 cells ml-1). Cyanobacteria co-occurred but only in small numbers (maximum of 5500 ml-1), mainly in surface waters. The vertical (physical) stability of the water column was pronounced, and the mean cellular red fluorescence signal of cells found at the bottom of the euphotic zone was consequently higher than in surface waters. Most remarkable were the net growth rates of the various species suggesting a highly dynamic phytoplankton community. Extreme growth rates included positive as well as negative values, which were not always consistent with the greatest abundance of certain species. Despite these rapid changes, the actual increase in plant carbon was only 14{\%} of the primary production.},

abstract = {To establish a metabolic state along a north{\^{a}}€“south transect in Antarctic waters, we approached community respiration (CR) from a combined perspective based on the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) and the size-scaling of the whole planktonic community. A detailed analysis of a summer integrated multi-trophic normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS), from heterotrophic bacteria to zooplankton, was carried out. To acquire individual size data, different techniques were combined: flow cytometry for smaller fractions ({\textless}20 {\^{A}}µm of equivalent spherical diameter), FlowCAM for larger nano- and microplankton and scanning and image analysis for the zooplankton fractions. The distribution of the NBSS was linear at all stations (R2 values: 0.87{\^{a}}€“0.93) but dome-shape features appeared related to phytoplankton cell distribution which are responsible for a large fraction of microbial respiration. Generally, the region showed an autotrophic budget south of the archipelago due to gross primary production (GPP) values up to 2804 mg C m{\^{a}}ˆ'2 day{\^{a}}ˆ'1, where salps could significantly contribute to the carbon export flux. Contrastingly, higher CR rates ({\textgreater}1000 mg C m{\^{a}}ˆ'2 day{\^{a}}ˆ'1) were found at the northern stations due to a higher phytoplankton respiration activity associated with increasing sea water temperatures and a higher presence of heterotrophic organisms (microheterotrophs, chaetognaths and copepods) resulting in a net heterotrophic metabolic state (GPP/CR {\textless} 1).},

@article{Sprules2016,
abstract = {Charles Elton introduced the “pyramid of numbers” in the late 1920s, but this remarkable insight into body-size dependent patterns in natural communities lay fallow until the theory of the biomass size spectrum was introduced by aquatic ecologists in the mid-1960s. They noticed that the summed biomass concentration of individual aquatic organisms was roughly constant across equal logarithmic intervals of body size from bacteria to the largest predators. These observations formed the basis for a theory of aquatic ecosystems, based on the body size of individual organisms, that revealed new insights into constraints on the structure of biological communities. In this review, we discuss the history of the biomass spectrum and the development of underlying theories. We indicate how to construct biomass spectra from sample data, explain the mathematical relations among them, show empirical examples of their various forms, and give details on how to statistically fit the most robust linear and nonlinear models ...},

@article{Edwards2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society.The size spectrum of an ecological community characterizes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size. Size spectra are often used as ecosystem indicators of marine systems. They have been fitted to data from various sources, including groundfish trawl surveys, visual surveys of fish in kelp forests and coral reefs, sediment samples of benthic invertebrates and satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll. Over the past decades, several methods have been used to fit size spectra to data. We document eight such methods, demonstrating their commonalities and differences. Seven methods use linear regression (of which six require binning of data), while the eighth uses maximum likelihood estimation. We test the accuracy of the methods on simulated data. We demonstrate that estimated size-spectrum slopes are not always comparable between the seven regression-based methods because such methods are not estimating the same parameter. We find that four of the eight tested methods can sometimes give reasonably accurate estimates of the exponent of the individual size distribution (which is related to the slope of the size spectrum). However, sensitivity analyses find that maximum likelihood estimation is the only method that is consistently accurate, and the only one that yields reliable confidence intervals for the exponent. We therefore recommend the use of maximum likelihood estimation when fitting size spectra. To facilitate this, we provide documented R code for fitting and plotting results. This should provide consistency in future studies and improve the quality of any resulting advice to ecosystem managers. In particular, the calculation of reliable confidence intervals will allow proper consideration of uncertainty when making management decisions.},

In this model, predation is the single process governing the energy flow in the ecosystem, as it causes both growth and mortality. The ratio of predator to prey is assumed to be distributed: predators may feed on a range of prey sizes. Under these assumptions, it is shown that linear size spectra are stationary solutions of the model. Exploited fish communities are simulated by adding fishing mortality to the model: it is found that realistic fishing should affect the curvature and stability of the size spectrum rather than its slope.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton size structure is key for the ecology and biogeochemistry of pelagic ecosystems, but the relationship between cell size and maximum growth rate ($\mu$(max) ) is not yet well understood. We used cultures of 22 species of marine phytoplankton from five phyla, ranging from 0.1 to 10(6) $\mu$m(3) in cell volume (V(cell) ), to determine experimentally the size dependence of growth, metabolic rate, elemental stoichiometry and nutrient uptake. We show that both $\mu$(max) and carbon-specific photosynthesis peak at intermediate cell sizes. Maximum nitrogen uptake rate (V(maxN) ) scales isometrically with V(cell) , whereas nitrogen minimum quota scales as V(cell) (0.84) . Large cells thus possess high ability to take up nitrogen, relative to their requirements, and large storage capacity, but their growth is limited by the conversion of nutrients into biomass. Small species show similar volume-specific V(maxN) compared to their larger counterparts, but have higher nitrogen requirements. We suggest that the unimodal size scaling of phytoplankton growth arises from taxon-independent, size-related constraints in nutrient uptake, requirement and assimilation.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton size structure controls the trophic organization of planktonic communities and their ability to export biogenic materials toward the ocean's interior. Our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the variability in phytoplankton size structure has been shaped by the assumption that the pace of metabolism decreases allometrically with increasing cell size. However, recent field and laboratory evidence indicates that biomass-specific production and growth rates are similar in both small and large cells but peak at intermediate cell sizes. The maximum nutrient uptake rate scales isometrically with cell volume and superisometrically with the minimum nutrient quota. The unimodal size scaling of phytoplankton growth arises from ataxonomic, size-dependent trade-off processes related to nutrient requirement, acquisition, and use. The superior ability of intermediate-size cells to exploit high nutrient concentrations explains their biomass dominance during blooms. Biogeographic patterns in phytoplankton size structure and growth rate are independent of temperature and driven mainly by changes in resource supply.

Even in a steady state ecosystem such as that analyzed here, there is variability in space and time; this suggests that one must be careful in extrapolating the relation to less predictable marine areas. In obtaining dynamic information from biomass spectra, one must distinguish changes due to the flow of energy within the spectrum (growth, predation, reproduction) from changes due to emi- gration from or immigration into the spectrum of the particular area sampled, such as those due to the diel vertical migration of macrozooplankton in the largest size classes.},

abstract = {Here we construct a fundamental mathematical theory of population dynamics in the context of the normalized spectra of abundance and biomass of plankton. The theory begins with the distribution function of abundance as a function of individual body weight and growth rate, and the law of the conservation of mass. The basic governing equations for population growth and biomass production are then deduced without empirical assumptions. The governing equations represent the fundamental mass balance between the biomass flux from small to large sizes due to individual growth and the sum of sources and sinks such as birth, death and mortality. The slope of the normalized biomass spectrum at steady state is proved to be approximately equal to the ratio of the intrinsic rate of increase in abundance to individual weight-specific growth rate. We demonstrated that measurements of biomass spectra in nature can be used to estimate population-dynamics parameters of individual growth rate and the intrinsic rate of increase. We further apply this population dynamics theory to data collected by an Optical Plankton Counter in the California Current region during June and July, 1993. These data cover a range in the marine biomass spectrum from 100 to 104 µg C individual body weight.},

abstract = {Quantification and comparisons of the structure of open-water plankton communities from 25 inland lakes of Ontario, from the Laurentian Great Lakes Superior, Huron, St. Clair, Ontario, and Erie, and from the Central Gyre in the North Pacific Ocean were made on the basis of the normalized biomass size spectrum. Residual variation around the fitted straight lines (corresponding to a theoretical steady state) was least for the large, oligotrophic Lake Superior and the North Pacific Gyre and greatest for eutrophic Saginaw Bay and shallow Lake Erie, suggesting progressive departure from steady-state conditions with increasing system productivity. The slopes of the normalized spectra decrease with increasing eutrophy, indicating that nannoplankton abundances are similar in all communities studied, but that associated zooplankton abundances vary by 2.5 orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that parameterization of particle-size models for prediction of potential fish production must be adjusted according to the size and productivity of the ecosystem, and that routine monitoring of communities by the normalized biomass spectrum could providd early warning of nutrient or toxic stress in aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {We have determined the scaling relationship between photosynthesis rate and cell size in natural phytoplankton assemblages of contrasting marine environments. We found that phytoplankton photosynthesis in the ocean does not scale as the L-power of cell size, but scales approximately isometrically with cell size, indicating that a single model cannot predict the metabolism–size relationship in all photosynthetic organisms. The scaling relationship between cellular chlorophyll a content and cell size is also isometric. Taxonomical changes along the size spectrum may explain the deviation of phytoplankton photosynthesis from the general allometric rule. The size scaling exponent for photosynthesis is significantly higher (1.14) in coastal productive waters than in the oligotrophic open ocean (0.96), which provides a physiological basis to explain the dominance of larger cells in nutrient-rich environments. The size scaling exponent for phytoplankton abundance is significantly less negative in coastal productive waters (-0.90) than in the oligotrophic open ocean (-1.25). The observed size scaling relationships imply that carbon fixation per unit volume decreases with cell size in oligotrophic waters, whereas the opposite occurs in productive ones. By controlling the metabolism–size scaling relationship, nutrient supply plays a major role in determining community size structure and the energy flow through the pelagic ecosystem.},

abstract = {1. Body size determines rates of respiration and production, energy requirements, mortality rates, patterns of predation and vulnerability to mortality. Body size distributions are often used to describe structure and energy flux in communities and ecosystems. 2. If clear relationships can be established between body size and trophic level in fishes, they may provide a basis for integrating community and ecosystem analyses based on size spectra, food webs and life histories. 3. We investigated relationships between the body sizes (weight and length) of northeast Atlantic fishes and their trophic level. The abundance of N-15, as determined by stable isotope analysis, was used as an index of trophic level. 4. Cross- species and comparative analyses demonstrated that body size was unrelated or weakly related to trophic level. Thus allometric relationships between body size and trophic level could not be used to predict the trophic structure of fish communities. 5. The results of the cross-species analyses contrasted with patterns in the size and trophic structure of entire fish communities. When fish communities were divided into size classes, there were strong positive relationships between size class and trophic level. The slope suggested a mean predator : prey body mass ratio of 80 : 1. 6. Our results suggest that body size does not provide a useful surrogate of trophic level for individual species, but that body size is an excellent predictor of trophic level within the community, providing an empirical basis for integrating community analyses based on models of trophic structure and body size distributions.},

abstract = {To ascertain the general patterns in phytoplankton size structure of a temperate, coastal ecosystem, we determined the scaling relationship between total abundance and cell size (size spectrum) for nano- and micro-phytoplankton in a shelf station off NW Iberian Peninsula on a monthly basis during the period 1993-2002. The inverse linear relationship between log abundance and log cell size was persistent throughout the water column and across seasonal and inter-annual time scales. In addition, and despite the high productivity and marked temporal variability in water column structure at our study site, departures from linearity in the size spectra were rare. The slope (-0.96) of the overall size spectrum for the entire time series indicated that roughly equal amounts of biomass were present over different logarithmic size classes in the size range considered. The phytoplankton size spectra had similar average slopes during winter mixing, early upwelling, summer stratification and autumn downwelling, suggesting that, under these oceanographic conditions, both nano- and micro-phytoplankton respond similarly to environmental variability. In contrast, significantly less negative slopes were observed during upwelling relaxation, indicating an increased importance of larger cells. Our results illustrate the utility of individual size distributions to provide a synthetic description of phytoplankton community structure in dynamic, non steady-state marine ecosystems.},

Mara{\~{n}}{\'{o}}n et al (2012) compiled a dataset of concurrent temperature and resource level proxies that they claim disentangled the effect of temperature from that of resource supply. They concluded that the hypothesis that temperature per se plays a direct role in controlling phytoplankton size structure should be rejected.

Although we obviously concur with Mara{\~{n}}{\'{o}}n et al (2012) in the long-known predominance of small phytoplankton cells under oligotrophic conditions, from our point of view this should not deter us from considering temperature as an important explanatory variable at a global scale since we show that, for the vast oligotrophic areas of the world's oceans where chlorophyll concentrations are below {\textless}1 $\mu$g L-1 temperature explains a high proportion of the variability in the size distribution of phytoplankton communities, a variability that can not be explained on the basis of the resource level proxies advocated by Mara{\~{n}}{\'{o}}n et al.

Meanwhile, reservoirs frequently go dry due to drought and/or water management decisions. Nonetheless, the fate of organic carbon buried in reservoir sediments upon drying is largely unknown. Here, we conducted a 45-day-long laboratory incubation of sediment cores collected from a western Mediterranean reservoir to investigate carbon dynamics in drying sediment. Drying sediment cores emitted more CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} over the course of the incubation than sediment cores incubated with overlaying water (206.7{\&}thinsp;{\&}plusmn;{\&}thinsp;47.9 vs. 69.2{\&}thinsp;{\&}plusmn;{\&}thinsp;18.1{\&}thinsp;mmol{\&}thinsp;CO2{\&}thinsp;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;day{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, mean{\&}thinsp;{\&}plusmn;{\&}thinsp;SE). Organic carbon content at the end of the incubation was lower in drying cores, which suggests that this higher CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} efflux was due to organic carbon mineralization. However, the apparent rate of organic C reduction in the drying sediments (568.6{\&}thinsp;{\&}plusmn;{\&}thinsp;247.2{\&}thinsp;mmol{\&}thinsp;CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;day{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, mean{\&}thinsp;{\&}plusmn;{\&}thinsp;SE) was higher than C emission. Meanwhile, sediment cores collected from a reservoir area that had already been exposed for 2+ years displayed net CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} influx from the atmosphere to the sediment ({\&}minus;136.0{\&}thinsp;{\&}plusmn;{\&}thinsp;27.5{\&}thinsp;mmol{\&}thinsp;CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;day{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, mean{\&}thinsp;{\&}plusmn;{\&}thinsp;SE) during the incubation period. Sediment mineralogy suggests that this CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} influx was caused by a relative increase in calcium carbonate chemical weathering. Thus, we found that while organic carbon decomposition in newly dry reservoir sediment causes measurable organic carbon loss and carbon gas emissions to the atmosphere, other processes can offset these emissions on short time frames and compromise the use of carbon emissions as a proxy for organic carbon mineralization in drying sediments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, the "damming effects" on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from tributaries of reservoirs in subtropical region were largely overlooked. In this study, we assessed the GHG fluxes (CH4, CO2and N2O) from air-water interface and the related factors in Xiangxi River of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region over one year. The annual average fluxes of CH4, CO2and N2O from Xiangxi River were 0.13±0.11mgm-2h-1, 16.01±23.21mgm-2h-1and 21.57±12.75$\mu$gm-2h-1, respectively, which were significantly lower than those from tropical rivers or lakes. The GHG fluxes showed strong seasonal dynamics: CH4was consistently released to the atmosphere and was more in summer than the other seasons. CO2was absorbed from the atmosphere in spring, but was emitted the most in winter. N2O flux was higher in cold season than in warm season. Additionally, CH4emission showed obvious spatial variations that decreased gradually from shallow to deep water-level areas. Correlation analysis demonstrated that CH4emission was negatively correlated with water depth and air-water temperature difference, and positively with air temperature. CO2flux was negatively related to chlorophyll a (Chl. a) and N2O flux was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO). The present study will deepen our understanding of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) construction impacts on GHG emissions in the tributaries, and help us to better estimate GHG emissions for TGR.},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of light, nutrients, and organic matter on gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP 5 GPP 2 R) in a dystrophic forest lake and an open eutrophic lake. Forest vegetation reduced incoming irradiance (20{\%}) and wind speed (34{\%}) in dystrophic Gribs{\o}, having thermal stratification 1 month longer than in eutrophic Slotss{\o}. While Gribs{\o} had nutrient-limited phytoplankton during most of the year, Slotss{\o} only experienced nutrient depletion during algal blooms. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorbed most light (average 82{\%}) in dystrophic Gribs{\o}, while phytoplankton and other particles absorbed most light (45{\%}) in eutrophic Slotss{\o}. GPP and NEP were positively related to irradiance in both lakes. However, because of higher CDOM absorbance, three times more light was needed to attain autotrophy in Gribs{\o}, being net heterotrophic (NEP , 0) for 79{\%}of all days, compared to 59{\%}in Slotss{\o}. This difference vanished when NEP was scaled to light absorption by pigments, although the eutrophic lake maintained a higher photon yield. Metabolic rates varied much more in Slotss{\o}, where higher light and nutrient availability facilitated occasional phytoplankton blooms, while low light and nutrient availability in Gribs{\o} dampened temporal variability. Both lakes were annually net heterotrophic with similar annual areal rates (NEP, 214 mol C m22). Net heterotrophy in dystrophic Gribs{\o} derives from high import of organic carbon-rich water, while heterotrophy in eutrophic Slotss{\o} is fueled by degradation of sediment pools of organic matter accumulated under previous hypereutrophic conditions, emphasizing the importance of lake history on the contemporary metabolic state.},

Soil sterilization disclosed an inorganic process of CO 2  dissolution into (during the night) and out of (during the day) the soil solution, driven by variation in soil temperature. Experimental and modeling analysis revealed that pH and soil moisture were the most important determinants of the magnitude of this inorganic CO 2  flux. In the extreme cases of air-dried saline/alkaline soils, this inorganic process was predominant. While the diurnal flux measured was zero sum, leaching of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the soil solution could potentially effect net carbon ecosystem exchange. This finding implies that an inorganic module should be incorporated when dealing with the CO 2  flux of saline/alkaline land. Neglecting this inorganic flux may induce erroneous or misleading conclusions in interpreting CO 2  fluxes of these ecosystems.},

Here we investigated both the magnitude and sources of CO2 emissions from lotic (i.e., running waters) and lentic (i.e., stagnant waters associated to small dams) waterbodies of a Mediterranean fluvial network by computing segment-scale mass balances of CO2. Our results showed that sources other than internal metabolism sustained most (82{\%}) of the CO2 emissions from the studied fluvial network. The magnitude and sources of CO2 emissions in lotic waterbodies were highly dependent on hydrology, with higher emissions dominated by DIC inputs derived from the catchment during high flows and lower emissions partially fueled by CO2 produced biologically within the river during low flows. In contrast, CO2 emissions in lentic waterbodies were low, relatively stable over the time and the space, and dominated by DIC inputs from the catchment regardless of the different hydrological situations. Overall, our results stress the sensitivity of fluvial networks to human activities and climate change and particularly highlight the role of hydromorphological conditions on modulating the magnitude and sources of CO2 emissions from fluvial networks.},

Carbon-isotope fractionations between adsorbate and vapor ($\Delta$13Ca-v = 1000. In ($\alpha$a-v), where $\alpha$ = substrates and temperatures over the range 190 to 230 K. These fractionations are 'reversed' relative to the common expectation that heavy isotopomers should be concentrated into condensed phases relative to coexisting vapor (Lindemann, 1919). Oxygen-isotope fractionations between adsorbate and vapor are complex: Comparison of experiments using vacuum-baked substrates to those in which substrates were not vacuum-baked suggests that exchange between one or both phases of CO2 and water adsorbed on the sample surfaces influences the 18O/16O fractionation between vapor and adsorbate and changes the 18O/16O composition of the total CO2 in the experiment. In experiments on vacuum-baked substrates, oxygen results exhibited 'normal' fractionation of Ο 1.8‰ (that is, 18O preferentially partitioned into the adsorbed CO2). No evidence was found for measurable exchange of oxygen isotopes between structural oxygen in mineral substrates and CO2 adsorbed on those substrates. The observation that 13C is enriched in the vapor phase may help account for subtle (per mil to tens of per mil) enrichments of 13C estimated for the Martian atmosphere as compared to bulk terrestrial carbon.

abstract = {Bacterioplankton respiration (BR) may represent the largest single sink of organic carbon in the biosphere and constitutes an important driver of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from freshwaters. Complete understanding of BR is precluded by the fact that most studies need to assume a respiratory quotient (RQ; mole of CO(2) produced per mole of O(2) consumed) to calculate rates of BR. Many studies have, without clear support, assumed a fixed RQ around 1. Here we present 72 direct measurements of bacterioplankton RQ that we carried out in epilimnetic samples of 52 freshwater sites in Qu{\'{e}}bec (Canada), using O(2) and CO(2) optic sensors. The RQs tended to converge around 1.2, but showed large variability (s.d.=0.45) and significant correlations with major gradients of ecosystem-level, substrate-level and bacterial community-level characteristics. Experiments with natural bacterioplankton using different single substrates suggested that RQ is intimately linked to the elemental composition of the respired compounds. RQs were on average low in net autotrophic systems, where bacteria likely were utilizing mainly reduced substrates, whereas we found evidence that the dominance of highly oxidized substrates, for example, organic acids formed by photo-chemical processes, led to high RQ in the more heterotrophic systems. Further, we suggest that BR contributes to a substantially larger share of freshwater CO(2) emissions than presently believed based on the assumption that RQ is ∼1. Our study demonstrates that bacterioplankton RQ is not only a practical aspect of BR determination, but also a major ecosystem state variable that provides unique information about aquatic ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {In the context of reservoirs, sediment trapping, and aquatic greenhouse gas (GHG) production, knowledge about the distribution of hot and low spots is essential for improved measurement strategies. It is also a key to a precise assessment of the GHG emissions of each reservoir. Large numbers of reservoirs are used mainly for hydroelectric power generation and, hence, affected by strong changes in water level. Drawdown events may lead to significant changes in spatial sediment and organic carbon distribution and, consequently, strongly alter the GHG emission patterns of the water body. We combined hydroacoustic sediment classification, sediment magnitude detection, and ebullition flux assessment with in-situ pore water investigations and sediment coring to detect ebullition distribution patterns after strong reservoir drawdown. The research was conducted in the Capivari Reservoir in the southeast of Brazil, which was affected by up to 15 m of drawdown within the last 10 years. Results show severe changes in sediment accumulation and composition. The focusing of sediment divides the reservoir in extreme hot and low spots. Methane pore water concentrations are highly correlated with acoustic backscatter values (r2 = 0.97) as well as with the organic carbon content (r2 = 0.55) and allow for a precise detection of the newly created emission patterns. Highly productive sediment could be acoustically distinguished from non-productive areas. Only 23.6{\%} of the reservoir surface produced 64{\%} of the detected bubbles. An organic carbon content in the sediment of 2.4{\%} was found to be a prerequisite for the formation of GHG emission hot spots. These findings may help to complement the still insufficient knowledge of methane ebullition fluxes from reservoirs with changing water levels.},

The equivalent electron and carbon flow of the reactions were also calculated to obtain a mass balance within the hypolimnia of UML. From the calculations, the approximate organic carbon decomposition rate, measured as CO$\backslash$2082 accumulation, was 7.54 mmol m$\backslash$207B² d$\backslash$207B¹. The amount of decomposition from the reactions involving nitrate, sulfate, iron and methane formation together accounted for 80{\%} of the total organic carbon decomposition. Therefore, 20{\%} of the CO$\backslash$2082 accumulation in UML could not be accounted for. Possible explanations for the excess CO$\backslash$2082 production could be the formation of reduced iron minerals and/or the loss of methane due to ebullition and oxidation. Such explanations suggest future studies of UML to better resolve the electron budget. In order to study the redox balance in Upper Mystic Lake, a method was devised for precisely sampling dissolved gases in the water column. Like other stratified lakes, UML has a large amount of anaerobic metabolism of organic matter occurring in the sediments and a subsequent accumulation of methane (CH$\backslash$2084) and carbon dioxide (CO$\backslash$2082) in the hypolimnia. Previously, limnological sampling for dissolved gases involved filling glass bottles with water pumped from depth using a peristaltic pump; however, such methods introduce the potential for gas exchange with the atmosphere. Therefore, there was a need for a dissolved gas sampler that could be used to obtain samples at precise depth intervals while at the same time isolating the samples from outside influences.},

abstract = {Gas ebullition of river impoundments plays an increasingly significant role, particularly in transporting methane CH 4 from their sediments to the atmosphere, and contributing to the global carbon budget and global warming. Quantifying stochastic and episodic nature of gas ebullition is complicated espe-cially when conventionally conducted by using coverage-limited gas traps. Current knowledge of seasonality in a reservoir's gas ebullition is lacking in the literature. For this reason, advanced acoustic surveying was intensively applied to determine spatiotemporal distributions of gas ebullition in a European water-storage reservoir for two years. Additionally, the sampling was accompanied with gas collecting for analyzing gas composition. The gas released from the reservoir was primarily composed of CH 4 (on average 52{\%}, up to 94{\%}). The longitudinal distribution of gas ebullition was mainly determined by a proximity to the river inflow as a source of organic matter. A magnitude of ebullitive fluxes within the reservoir varied up to 1,300 mL m 22 d 21 (30 mmol CH 4 m 22 d 21). The most significant period of ebullition has turned out to be in fall, on average reaching a sevenfold ebullitive flux (70 mL m 22 d 21 , 1.6 mmol CH 4 m 22 d 21) higher than in the rest of the season. A substantial contribution to the fall peak was induced by an expansion of gas ebullition into greater depths, covering two thirds of the reservoir in late fall. The study demonstrates that the ebullitive fluxes of the temperate water storage reservoir were correlated to season, depth, and inflow proximity.},

abstract = {Significant improvements have been made in estimating gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respira- tion (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP) from diel, “free-water” changes in dissolved oxygen (DO). Here we evaluate some of the assumptions and uncertainties that are still embedded in the technique and provide guide- lines on how to estimate reliable metabolic rates from high-frequency sonde data. True whole-system estimates are often not obtained because measurements reflect an unknown zone of influence which varies over space and time. A minimum logging frequency of 30 min was sufficient to capture metabolism at the daily time scale. Higher sampling frequencies capture additional pattern in the DO data, primarily related to physical mixing. Causes behind the often large daily variability are discussed and evaluated for an oligotrophic and a eutrophic lake. Despite a 3-fold higher day-to-day variability in absolute GPP rates in the eutrophic lake, both lakes required at least 3 sonde days per week for GPP estimates to be within 20{\%} of the weekly average. A sensitivity analysis evaluated uncertainties associated with DO measurements, piston velocity (k), and the assumption that daytime R equals nighttime R. In low productivity lakes, uncertainty in DO measurements and piston velocity strongly impacts R but has no effect on GPP or NEP. Lack of accounting for higher R during the day underestimates R and GPP but has no effect on NEP. We finally provide suggestions for future research to improve the technique.},

abstract = {This paper summarises the results of an extensive field campaign which demonstrates that high sediment organic matter is the primary driver of methane ebullition in a sub-tropical, freshwater reservoir. Methane emissions from freshwater reservoirs represent an important global methane source. Whilst diffusive methane fluxes are commonly used for predicting total emissions, recent studies show that the under-reported ebullitive fluxes can vary by over three orders of magnitude within an individual system and have a greater relative contribution compared to diffusion. Key to predicting this variability in emission rates is to better understand the primary drivers of different emission pathways, and in particular ebullition. Zones of catchment derived organic material as well as elevated water column chlorophyll a concentration have been associated with increased rates of ebullition. Little Nerang Dam (LND), a subtropical freshwater reservoir in Queensland Australia, consistently experiences high rates of ebullition adjacent to major inflow arms that are both deposition zones of catchment organic material as well as areas with elevated water column chlorophyll a concentration. A year-long study of emission rates was undertaken on LND during which water column chlorophyll a concentration, bottom water temperature and sediment organic matter content were assessed for methane ebullition potential. This included a transect with high-spatial sampling (259 sites) from the dam wall to the ebullition zones to explore the relationship between water column chlorophyll a concentration, sediment organic matter content and methane ebullition. These results showed that ebullition was associated with the large forest litter deposits adjacent to major inflow sites where sediment organic matter content was significantly higher compared with the main body of the reservoir.},

abstract = {This review article analyzes different abiotic processes that could contribute to the global carbon cycle on short time scales, beginning with high rates of net CO2 release or uptake measured over ecosystems by the FLUXNET community. The two main abiotic interpretations for these "anomalous" measurements are weathering processes and subterranean cavity ventilation. After analyzing their mechanisms and drivers, we evaluate their possible relevance and contributions in the studies mentioned above. Analyzing weathering (calcite dissolution and precipitation) chemistry and using a geochemical model, we conclude that CO2 dissolution processes could explain the measured CO2 release following dry season rain events, but their contribution is far from sufficient to explain large magnitudes of daytime CO2 emissions or annual CO2 uptake measured in some desert ecosystems. In this context, we hypothesize and evaluate a further abiotic mechanism: the role of subterranean cavities as a temporal depot of CO2, along with their seasonal ventilation. A first approximation estimates that the subterranean CO2 pool (and its potential ventilation) could represent more than half of the total CO2 content of the atmosphere. Therefore, the non-negligible potential contribution to the net ecosystem carbon balance requires further investigation towards a better understanding of its drivers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Metabolic rate calculations were made using a method that integrates rates across the entire depth profile and includes DO exchange between depth layers driven by mixed-layer deepening and eddy diffusivity. During full mixing, NEP was close to zero throughout the water column, and GPP and R were reduced 2{\&}ndash;10 times compared to stratified periods. When present, the metalimnion contributed 21 {\%} and 27 {\%} to whole-lake areal rates of GPP and R, respectively. Net autotrophy prevailed in the epilimnion (NEP = 11 +-  14 mmol O2 m-3 d-1 ; mean +- SD) compared to balanced production in the metalimnion (NEP = 2 +- 19 mmol O2 m-3 d-1 ) and net heterotrophic conditions in hypolimnic waters (NEP = -15 +- 24 mmol O2 m-3 d-1 ). Positive NEP occurred in the metalimnion during periods when the photic depth extended below the mixed-layer depth. Although the single-sonde method estimated higher areal GPP (19 {\%} ) and R (14 {\%} ) compared to the two depth-integrated approaches, differences were not significant. During stratification, daily variability in epilimnetic DO was dominated by metabolism (46 {\%} ) and air{\&}ndash;water gas exchange (44 {\%} ). Fluxes related to mixed-layer deepening dominated in meta- and hypolimnic waters (49 {\%} and 64 {\%} ), while eddy diffusion (1 {\%} and 14 {\%} ) was less important. Although air{\&}ndash;water gas exchange rates differed among the three formulations of gas-transfer velocity, this had no significant effect on metabolic rates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

During a three year study (1985-1987) we used a mass balance approach study the oxidation and reduction reactions related to decomposition of organic carbo Mirror Lake, New Hampshire. The stoichiometry of the reactions allows us to calculat electron transfer budget for the summer stratification period in the lake, as well a benthic chambers and sealed jars. The average decomposition rate measured as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) prod tion was 5.33 mmol m-2 d-{\~{}}. The proportions of decomposition accounted for by various electron acceptors varied both during the summer, as well as from year to year. average, oxygen accounted for 43{\%} of DIC production, while the processes involv sulfate, nitrate, iron and methane formation together accounted for 20{\%}. Despite conser tive assumptions we could not account for 37{\%} of the DIC production. The general patter including excess DIC production, was also observed in chamber studies conducted shallow-water sediments and in sealed-jar experiments. Data on burial rates of reduced iron minerals indicate that such minerals are not sufficient to account for the discrepancy in the electron budget. Our analysis suggest another electron acceptor such as organic carbon reduction, either via fermentatio selective oxidation, is the most likely explanation of excess DIC},

abstract = {We used a comparative data set for 25 lakes in Denmark sampled during summer to explore the influence of lake morphometry, catchment conditions, light availability and nutrient input on lake metabolism. We found that (1) gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (R) decline with lake area, water depth and drainage ratio, and increase with algal biomass (Chl), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP); (2) all lakes, especially small with less incident light, and forest lakes with high DOC, have negative net ecosystem production (NEP {\textless} 0); (3) daily variability of GPP decreases with lake area and water depth as a consequence of lower input of nutrients and organic matter per unit water volume; (4) the influence of benthic processes on free water metabolic measures declines with increasing lake size; and (5) with increasing lake size, lake metabolism decreases significantly per unit water volume, while depth integrated areal rates remain more constant due to a combination of increased light and nutrient limitation. Overall, these meta-parameters have as many significant but usually weaker relationships to whole-lake and benthic metabolism as have TP, Chl and DOC that are directly linked to photosynthesis and respiration. Combining water depth and Chl to predict GPP, and water depth and DOC to predict R, lead to stronger multiple regression models accounting for 57–63{\%} of the variability of metabolism among the 25 lakes. It is therefore important to consider differences in lake morphometry and catchment conditions when comparing metabolic responses of lakes to human impacts.},

@article{Gomez-Gener2016a,
abstract = {Inland waters are significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. CO2 supersaturation and subsequent CO2 emissions from inland waters can be driven by internal metabolism, external inputs of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) derived from the catchment, and other processes (e.g., internal geochemical reactions of calcite precipitation or photochemical mineralization of organic solutes). However, the sensitivity of the magnitude and sources of CO2 emissions to fluvial network hydromorphological alterations is still poorly understood. Here we investigated both the magnitude and sources of CO2 emissions from lotic (i.e., running waters) and lentic (i.e., stagnant waters associated to small dams) waterbodies of a Mediterranean fluvial network by computing segment-scale mass balances of CO2. Our results showed that sources other than internal metabolism sustained most (82{\%}) of the CO2 emissions from the studied fluvial network. The magnitude and sources of CO2 emissions in lotic waterbodies were highly dependent on hydrology, with higher emissions dominated by DIC inputs derived from the catchment during high flows and lower emissions partially fueled by CO2 produced biologically within the river during low flows. In contrast, CO2 emissions in lentic waterbodies were low, relatively stable over the time and the space, and dominated by DIC inputs from the catchment regardless of the different hydrological situations. Overall, our results stress the sensitivity of fluvial networks to human activities and climate change and particularly highlight the role of hydromorphological conditions on modulating the magnitude and sources of CO2 emissions from fluvial networks.},

abstract = {Constraints on hypolimnetic methane production in productive lakes are of interest owing to the importance of methane emissions from lakes for the atmospheric methane burden. We studied carbon fluxes and terminal electron accepting processes in the hypolimnion of eutrophic Meerfelder Maar, Germany. Carbon fluxes from epilimnion and sediments were estimated using sediment traps, porewater analysis and incubation techniques. The contribution of various redox processes to overall dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production was quantified from a seasonal hypolimnetic mass balance. Carbon sedimentation rates were 22 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from the epilimnion and 20-34 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from the hypolimnion. Anaerobic respiration accounted for a DIC production of 21 mmol m(-2) d(-1), and was thus capable of using a substantial part of primary production. The diffusive C flux from the sediment was small in comparison, although potential respiration rates in incubation experiments reached 63 - 75 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Ebullition of methane occurred, but could not be quantified. Following depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate, iron and sulphate reduction and methanogenesis proceeded concurrently in the hypolimnion. Estimated hypolimnetic DIC production decreased in the order methanogenesis (2267 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} oxic respiration (880 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} sulphate reduction (575mmolm(-2)) {\textgreater} denitrification (159 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} acetogenesis (157 mmol m(-2)) {\textgreater} iron reduction (19 - 144 mmol m(-2)). Methane production thus dominated respiration and was not inhibited by sulphate and iron reduction. It also strongly accelerated with increased carbon sedimentation rates in September, which apparently eased limiting factors on the process. Hypolimnetic methane production is thus likely an important process in similar lakes, even in the presence of other electron acceptors, and will contribute to methane emissions during fall turnover.},
